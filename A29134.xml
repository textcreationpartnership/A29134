            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was at your requeſt, and the earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſome of your Friends, that I was induced to publiſh theſe following Sermons. The reaſon whereof I ſuppoſe to be, becauſe your heart was (in ſome meaſure) opened to, and affected with the voice of Chriſt in his Word, when you heard it. I muſt confeſs, the matter or ſubject herein treated of, is very ſweet and precious, and ſuch as may well warm the frozen heart of any, that hath the leaſt drachm of ſincere love, either of complacency in, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration to Chriſt. To ſee how ready Chriſt is to condeſcend to the requeſts of his Spouſe, how ſweetly, and with what melting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap> and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful he is in the emanations of his Grace and Kindneſs towards her: And then on the other hand to conſider, how ſleightly ſhe looks upon him, how little account ſhe makes of him; and how ſhe makes him dance attendance at her door,
<pb facs="tcp:45968:3"/>
with many other circumſtances of her unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and withal to conſider the danger and hazard which ſhe runs, by her unkind behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards Chriſt: Theſe Conſiderations (which are the ſubject of the enſuing Diſcourſe) being ſeriouſly weighed by a Soul that hath any love for, or breathings after Chriſt (among the number of which, I hope, I may truely reckon you) cannot chooſe but in ſome meaſure awaken the ſleepy Soul, and warm the cold and frozen Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. This effect I perceive the Word had upon you; for which you owe the thanks and praiſe to the Spirit of Grace, which accompanied the Word to your heart, and gave it entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there. For man ſpeaks only to the ear, it is God that ſpeaks to the heart: You having therefore taſted the ſweetneſs of this Word your ſelf, deſired the communication of it to others, who had not the opportunity (with you) to hear it; and in order thereunto, the publication of it. Your deſigne I muſt own to be good: for Grace (where it is in truth) is not only of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive nature, (ſpreading it ſelf through the whole man) but alſo of a communicative nature; wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all by-ſtanders might likewiſe taſte that ſweetneſs, which it ſelf is much delighted with. Grace deſires not to eat its morſels alone, but if any Banquet be given in by Chriſt, or any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment by his company, the Soul cries out to
<pb facs="tcp:45968:3"/>
by-ſtanders, <hi>O taſte and ſee how good the Lord is! He is altogether lovely. Come,</hi> therefore, <hi>and I will tell you what he hath done for my Soul.</hi> But (though your deſigne be good, yet) the weakneſs and inſufficiency of the Author, might well have pleaded an excuſe. For it is pity that ſuch a ſweet and precious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhould be rendred deſpicable, by being handed into the world by ſo weak, rude and unpoliſhed an inſtrument, as I muſt of neceſſity confeſs my ſelf to be. For I am ſenſible, that many times the Truths of Chriſt ſuffer in the world, through the weakneſs of the Inſtruments that hand them to us. However, yet (ſometimes) it pleaſeth God, <hi>By the mouths of babes and ſucklings to perfect his own praiſe;</hi> that the work may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be not of men, but of God. Leaving therefore the work in Gods hand (who is able to do what he pleaſeth with and by it) and waving the conſideration of mine own weakneſs, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to your requeſt, and make bold <hi>to caſt this my poor mite into Gods Treaſury:</hi> Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you and to all courteous Readers, as <hi>Peter</hi> to the Cripple, Acts <hi>3.6. Silver and Gold have I none; but ſuch as I have, give I unto you.</hi> I hope the food is wholeſome, though it be but plainly and meanly dreſſed. And though it may fall into the hands of ſome, whoſe curious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks may loath ſuch plain and homely diet;

yet poſſibly it may fall into the hand of ſome poor creature, who is <hi>hungry, humble, and of a contrite Spirit, and trembles at Gods Word.</hi> Some poor hungry Soul may (perhaps) here meet with meat, though there be little ſawce to he had: And if any poor Soul ſhall reap benefit by my poor labours and endeavours (I hope) I ſhall bleſs God for owning ſuch a worthleſs creature, in ſo glorious a work. And (if it do good) the leſs of the inſtrument, the more will there be of God ſeen in it.

            <p>THe <hi>Spirit of Slumber</hi> exceedingly prevails at this day; as great ſecurity is to be found in this Nation, as was in the old World and in <hi>Sodom,</hi> before the <hi>one</hi> was Drowned, and the <hi>other</hi> Burned. God hath uſed ſeveral ways and means to awaken us; but our Spiritual Lethargie proves a very ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Malady.

And therefore in the underſtanding of it, we muſt not acquieſce in the immediate literal Senſe, I mean, in the immediate or Grammatical ſenſe which the words bear; but muſt look through them to the mediate, literal, or ſpiritual Senſe that is couched in them. For the literal Senſe of the Scripture is, that Senſe which the Holy Ghoſt immediately and primarily intends in that portion of Scripture, whether delivered in Proper, or Figurative Expreſſions. And therefore the Literal and Spiritual Senſe are here one and the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As touching the general Scope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of this Book; it is to ſet forth the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love, ſpiritual Union and Communion between Chriſt and his Church; and their mutual carriage and deportment towards each other in ſeveral conditions, and under various diſpenſations; brought in, and carried on by way of Dialogue and diſcourſe between ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons.</p>

their parts in this Dialogue or Diſcourſe, are principally three. Firſt, The Bridegroom, by which we muſt underſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 2. The Bride or Spouſe, by which underſtand the Church, either in general or particular Believers. 3. The Daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. by which we may underſtand either young Converts, or viſible Believers.</p>
               <p>The perſons ſpoken of, are, 1. The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, which is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 2. The Bride, the <hi>Church.</hi> 3. The Friends of the Bridegroom; which are the <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of Chriſt. 4.

               <p>The particular knowledge of the Perſons ſpeaking and ſpoken of, or to, in every place; will give much light for the diſcovery and right underſtanding of the thing or matter that is ſpoken; and therefore this is neceſſary to be obſerved in every part of this Book.</p>
               <p>The perſons here ſpeaking in this Chapter and diſcourſing of and with each other, are <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Spouſe.</hi> In the Text we have a rehearſal by the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> his ſpeech to her, and of her carriage and deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45968:8"/>If you caſt your eye back to the laſt Verſe of the foregoing chapter, you ſhall find the <hi>Spouſe</hi> making her requeſt to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the revival of her Graces, and the return of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into her ſoul. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> would prepare and make ready her Heart, by quickning, inlivening, and enlarging Grace, and putting it into a poſture fit for Exerciſe, for the entertainment of him; and being thus prepared for his entertainment, that he would pleaſe to come in and taſte of that Feaſt which himſelf had prepared. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the firſt Verſe of this Chapter <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes anſwer to her requeſt, telling her that he was come, and had brought his Friends with him, to wit, his Miniſters, that they, as well as he, might be delighted with that Feaſt. For it is no ſmall refreſhment unto the Friends, or faithful Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſee and taſte of the flouriſhing Graces of the People or <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yea, he invites her alſo to taſte of the ſweetneſs of his Grace in her ſelf, that ſhe might be refreſhed with what he had revived and refreſhed in her. But ſhe (poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly being weary with waiting ſo long and late for him, not expecting his company at that time of the night) was gone to bed, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len aſleep, as ſhe her ſelf confeſſeth, Verſe the 2. But as late as it was, <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes and knocks, and ſhe hears, and knew his voice, and gives
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45968:8"/>
us an account what he ſaid to her. As ſhe had but now made her ſute and requeſt to him, deſiring him to come: ſo he being come, makes another kind and loving motion to her, and ſuch a one as was very reaſonable, and (one would have thought) would have been readily embraced. She had begged of him that he would come; and now being come, and finding her in bed, he begs of her that ſhe would open to him, and let him in. But alas poor <hi>Spouſe!</hi> as if ſhe had forgot her reſpect to her Husband, the benefit and deſireableneſs of his company, and her own requeſt ſo lately made, ſhe gives him a flat denial, couched under ſome complemental excuſes, Verſe 3. <hi>I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> She could wiſh to have <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but is too lazy to riſe out of her bed to open to him. She would have <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Comforts, but would not be at the pains to perform any duty of obedience unto him, would not open to him by faith: but <hi>Chriſt</hi> having a more warm Heart and Affection for her than ſhe had for him, reſolves not ſo to be put off; and being reſolved to ſpeed in his requeſt, will not ſo let her alone; and therefore powerfull (yet ſweetly) makes an aſſault upon the Door of her Heart, ſo effectually moving upon her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45968:9"/>
and awakening her Graces, that ſhe can no longer deny, but ariſeth to open to him, and by ariſing and coming to the door, finds a wonderful change and alteration in her ſelf, <hi>V.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for him. I roſe up to open to my beloved, and my hands dropped with myrrhe, and my fingers with ſweet ſmelling myrrhe, upon the handles of the lock.</hi> She no ſooner begins to act faith upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but ſhe found encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to let him in. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had thus perſumed her Lock with but putting in his Finger by the hole of the Door, Oh what would his company be when himſelf came in! And therefore, without any more delay or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, in all haſte ſhe opens to him, <hi>v.</hi> 6. But <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though he would not utterly forſake her and caſt her off, yet he would make her ſenſible of the affront which ſhe had offered him, and of her ungrateful carriage towards him; and therefore withdraws, and makes her who (but now) was ſo delicate and eaſeful that ſhe could not put on her Coat, or come barefoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the houſe-floor) to ſeek him in the ſtreets, and take many a wet and weary ſtep in the dark night, and that (queſtionleſs) with an aking Heart, having his perſumes ſo freſh in her Breaſt, and her own guilt ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45968:9"/>
freſh upon her Conſcience, before ſhe find him. This was the caſe between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Spouſe</hi> at this time.</p>
               <p>I ſhall but in a word mention thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in the Text, upon which I deſigne to ground the Doctrine, and ſo proceed to the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>In the whole Conference or Relation I ſhall take notice of theſe things, upon which I ſhall ground the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Churches Prayer, chap. 4.16. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake O North-wind, and come thou South,</hi> &amp;c. She prays for the breathing Influences of the Spirit, whereby her Graces may be revived and made fit for action; and then deſires <hi>Chriſt's</hi> company, when ſhe is fixed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Anſwer to the Church her Prayer, chap. 5.1. The <hi>Spouſe</hi> no ſooner calls, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes Anſwer; no ſooner invites, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The poſture which he finds her in at his coming: gone to bed, and compoſing her ſelf to ſleep. Believers do ſometimes pray for that which they have no patience to wait for.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Call and Propoſal which he makes to the <hi>Spouſe</hi> at his coming; which is but very reaſonable, ſince his coming was at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45968:10"/>
her requeſt, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Open to me, my ſiſter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We have the <hi>Spouſe</hi> her unreaſonable denial and excuſes, <hi>v.</hi> 3. She litte conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how wet and weary Chriſt was, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted but poor reſpect to him, when ſhe will rather ſuffer him to ſtand there, than ſhe will be at the trouble to put on her Coat, or defile her Feet. Oh what difference is here between <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s love to us, and our love to him!</p>
               <p n="6">6. We may obſerve the effect of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal and unreaſonable denial. Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> rouze up her Graces, and give her ſome taſte of his excellency, which may make her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedly to ſeek him: yet he will make her ſmart for her lazyneſs and indifferency, and low value which ſhe ſet by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He will make her take abundantly more pains before ſhe find him. She ſhall ſeek him with a fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aking Heart, and in ſeeking take many a wet and weary ſtep; feel a little of what he endured at the door, before ſhe find him. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>From all theſe conſiderations in the Text, I gather this Doctrine:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a dangerous thing, and may coſt us dear, to be lazy and ſecure when Chriſt knocks and calls; eſpecially when his coming and calling is in anſwer to our Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45968:10"/>This truth is not onely the ſenſe and ſum of this Text, but we find the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking the ſame thing for ſubſtance in other parts of Scripture. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, and following verſes. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; But ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproofs:</hi> Therefore, <hi>I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 81.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Hear, O my people— There ſhall be no ſtrange God in thee — I am the Lord thy God— But my people would not bearken — So I gave them up— O that my people would have hearkned</hi>— Luke 13.34, 35. <hi>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem, how often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thee, as an hen gathereth her chickens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her wings, but ye would not — Wherefore your city is left to you deſolate</hi>— Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock: If any man open to me, I will come in unto him, and I will ſup with him, and be with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the further proſecution of this Doctrine, I ſhall (through Gods aſſiſtance) obſerve this method.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Speak ſomething by way of Explication. 2. Something by way of Confirmation. 3. Something by way of Application. In the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Doctrine, I ſhall endeavour

to ſhew, 1. Where <hi>Chriſt</hi> knocks. 2. At whoſe door <hi>Chriſt</hi> knocks. 3. How, or with what he knocks. 4. For what end he knocks: Or what it is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have when he knocks. 5. What are the ſpecial times of his knocking.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe, <hi>Where it is that Chriſt knocks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Knock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Calls are at the door of man's Heart. To have the Ear open to God's call ſignifies lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if the door of the Heart be ſhut, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot get in there. We ſee in the Text the <hi>Spouſe</hi> (though partly aſleep) heard <hi>Chriſts</hi> Knock and Call well enough, and yet ſhe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to depart from her, becauſe ſhe did not open to him. Wiſdom cries, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>My ſon, give me thine heart. Chriſt</hi> will have the Heart open, or elſe he will not come in; and that for theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no diſſembler, but real in what he offers and gives: ſo he loves no diſſembling; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that the Soul ſhould be real and cordial with him. Now, to pretend to embrace <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not to do it with all the Heart, is to mock him, and diſſemble with him. This God complains of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And yet for all this her treacherous ſiſter</hi> Judah <hi>hath not turned to me with the whole heart, but feignedly, ſaith
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45968:11"/>
the Lord.</hi> This is no better than flattery or lying in God's account. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36, 37. They pretended <hi>to return,</hi> and <hi>ſeek early after God. Nevertheleſs they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue; for their heart was not right with him. Jeremiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains thus of the wicked, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Thou art near them in their lips, but far from their reins.</hi> That Son was rejected, who ſaid, <hi>I go Sir,</hi> but went not. This diſſembling and complementing with God, is abominable to the heart-ſearching God: And therefore he requires that the Heart be opened unto him, and there it is that he knocks.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Heart is the chief part of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his purchaſe, and therefore he knocks there. It is true, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Redeemer of the Body: but had not that been an appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the more noble part, the <hi>Soul, Chriſt</hi> would never have paid ſo dear a price for it. But the inward man, the <hi>Soul,</hi> or <hi>Heart,</hi> was that which was chiefly in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s eye, when he made his <hi>Soul</hi> an Offering for Sin. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.23. <hi>My lips ſhall greatly rejoyce— and my</hi> Soul <hi>which thou haſt redeemed.</hi> The Soul is the Jewel which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed; and therefore though he ought to have the Box or Cabinet with it, yet the Cabinet without the Jewel will not give him content. It is the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45968:12"/>
Heart or Soul therefore that he calls for, when he knocks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Heart is the Royal Seat, or Throne, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes not to be a truckle-bed Gueſt, but to rule and reign in us: and and therefore if he have the Heart, which is the commanding faculty, the Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, he may by that command the whole man; but without this, it will be in vain, if not impoſſible, to keep poſſeſſion of the other parts of the man. The Heart is the fountain, from whence the ſtreams that run in every part of the man proceed; if this be not pure, the ſtreams muſt needs be filthy: And therefore <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. we are commanded to <hi>Keep the Heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of Life.</hi> The Heart is always full, and is continually ſending forth Legions of thoughts, words and actions, either good or bad: How ſhould <hi>Chriſt</hi> keep the outward man quietly, if the heart be not for him? Our Saviour ſpeaks it as an impoſſibility, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.34, 35. that <hi>they being evil</hi> ſhould <hi>ſpeak good things;</hi> and gives the reaſon of it, Becauſe that <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaks:</hi> and therefore according as the heart is diſpoſed and qualified, ſuch are the thoughts, words and actions. The <hi>good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth good
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45968:12"/>
things; the evil man out of the evil treaſure of the heart evil things:</hi> How ſhould the fruit be good, when the tree is bad? The heart then, if it be not for Chriſt, will dayly be ſending forth ſuch troops of filthy moleſting enemies, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall have no quiet abode near it; and therefore he will either have the Royal Fort delivered and opened to him, or he will not come there. If the heart be filthy, the whole man is defiled with what iſſues from thence: and ſee what flouds of ſtinking filthineſs iſſue from the heart, and defile the man, Mat. 15.18, 19, 20. <hi>Evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, Falſe witneſs, Blaſphemies;</hi> And how then ſhall the ſweet breath of <hi>Chriſt</hi> endure near ſuch a ſink of filthineſs? if he may not come to the ſpring or riſe of it to purge it, there will be no long ſtay for him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will have the Heart or none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his chief ſuit and requeſt is for our love, and this he cannot have without the Heart, becauſe it is ſeated in the heart; and though it ſend its ſervants abroad, yet it ſelf never ſtirs from thence: and therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot have this, unleſs he have the Heart. Such is <hi>Chriſts</hi> love towards his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> that he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſires to be married to her; and the Terms he propoſeth, are Marriage-terms,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45968:13"/>
wherein Love is the chief and principal. And great reaſon he ſhould have this, not only in regard of his great Love wherewith he hath loved us, and the fruits and effects of it; but alſo in regard we have nothing elſe to give him: nor can he expect any other thing with us that may be deſireable.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will have the heart opened where he comes, becauſe the Feaſts and Banquets which he hath prepared and brings with him, chiefly reſpect the heart: the outward man is little or nothing concerned in them, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by them, unleſs it be by conſequence. <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Feaſts are Spiritual, and therefore but little grateful to the fleſh, or outward man. The word that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks is part of his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet or Feaſt; and <hi>David</hi> ſaith they are ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Honey or the Honey-comb. But what Refreſhment or Feaſt would theſe be to the body, or outward man, if the Heart take no notice of them, and be not affected with them? and therefore <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Chriſt</hi> would allure his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> and take her into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and there would ſpeak comfortably to her: or, ſpeak to her Heart (as the word ſignifies.) Words yield but little comfort or refreſhment, if they be not ſpoken to the Heart. <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us he will give his Fleſh and Blood to feed us, and this but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an imaginary way neither; for we muſt not really have his Body and Blood after a corporeal manner, but ſpiritually repreſented and adumbrated by a little broken Bread, and poured-forth Wine. If this Feaſt therefore extend to, or concern nothing more than the Body, it will prove but a poor hungry
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45968:14"/>
Feaſt: he findes it ſo, that goes away from the Ordinance without finding and feeding upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith. And therefore were not the Banquet Spiritual, and ſuch as immediately concerns the Heart, the Scripture would never call it a Feaſt of Marrow and Wine ſetled upon the lees; nor would <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5. that his Soul was <hi>ſatisfied, as with marrow and fatneſs,</hi> when he fed upon this. And therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Feaſts being chiefly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and reſpecting the Heart, they would be loſt, and ſignifie nothing, if the Heart were not opened to him: And therefore the place where <hi>Chriſt</hi> knocks is the door of the Heart, which he requires ſhould be opened to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next thing to be enquired into is, <hi>At whoſe door doth Chriſt knock?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That Chriſt knocks at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones door, that lives under Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Diſpenſations. There is no perſon living under Goſpel-Ordinances, but at one time or another <hi>Chriſt</hi> knocks at the door of his heart, requiring entrance and admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thou that readeſt, or heareſt this Word, whoever thou be, Male or Female, Bond or Free, Young or Old, Rich or Poor, High or Low, whatever order, rank, or degree thou be of, in whatever condition or ſtate thou be at thy door it is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by this word
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45968:14"/>
knocks, ſaying, <hi>Open to me,</hi> &amp;c. See the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s knock or call, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>I ſtand at the door and knock: if any man will open to me, I will come in unto him, and will ſup with him, and he with me. Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come. And let him that heareth, ſay, Come. Let him that is athirſt come. And whoſoever will, let him come, and take of the waters of life freely.</hi> Iſai. 55.1. <hi>He, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and he that hath no money: come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price.</hi> Chriſt knocks not onely at the Hearts of his own people, as here of the <hi>Spouſe, Open my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled:</hi> But alſo at the doors of others, ſuch as are unregenerate, and know him not. Only with this difference; at the doors of his own regenerate ones, he calls for the awakening and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ring up the grace which he hath beſtowed upon them: but to ſuch as are unregenerate, and yet ſtrangers to him, he calls them to Faith and Repentance, and to come unto him, that they may live and finde reſt for their Souls, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30. To Believers he calls, to awaken their Graces that are already implanted in their Hearts: But to Unbelievers he calls, to awaken them out of their ſleep in Sin and ſecurity.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45968:15"/>
And of theſe, there is not the meaneſt Soul nor the greateſt Sinner left out of his call: and if any man will but open to him, he will come in; though their Sins be as Scarlet, and crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he will make them as Snow and Wool. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The next enquiry is, <hi>How, or with what Chriſt knocks and calls?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to this I anſwer, <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily knock and call by an immediate voice from Heaven, as he did upon <hi>Saul,</hi> Act. 9. but under the Goſpel God ordinarily calls ſome one or more of theſe ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt knocks or calls, ſometimes by his Providences. Chriſt many times ſends ſome remarkable Providence or other to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken Sinners out of their ſleep in Sin, and to awaken the Graces of his People, when they are ſleepy and ſluggiſh: and theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences they are of two ſorts: ſometimes ſuch as we call Mercies; (though all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations in this caſe are Mercies, and the fruits of his faithfulneſs) but by Mercies I mean ſuch things as are Joyous and deſirable for the preſent. He ſometimes loads his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Bleſſings and Benefits. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.3, 4. And every Mercy in this kinde is an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and quickning ſpur unto duty. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God complains, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.8. that <hi>they did
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45968:15"/>
not conſider that he gave them corn, and wine, and oyl, wool and flax, ſilver and gold,</hi> which they ſhould have ſerved him withal: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not, threatens to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Therefore we finde this laid down as the ground of that God's Expoſtulation with his People, <hi>Deut,</hi> 32.6, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God ſhould lead perſons to Repentance; God expects it, and by this many times calls. Sometimes God calls by his Corrections and Judgements, ſtriving by the ſmartneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his Judgements, to awaken Sinners, that are rather hardned by Proſperity, and to affright them out of their ſleep in ſin, and to awaken his own people out of that ſleep which they have lulled themſelves into by Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus we read, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9, &amp;c. when he lays perſons in <hi>Fetters</hi> and <hi>Irons</hi> of <hi>Affliction, Then he ſhews them their way and their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, wherein they have exceeded.</hi> And of theſe two ways of knocking, uſually Mercy and Goodneſs leads the way; and if that will not do, then Judgement, and the Rod follows after: <hi>For God doth not willingly grieve and afflict the children of men,</hi> Lam. 3.33. But <hi>if need be, they muſt be in heavineſs through mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold tribulations and temptations,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6. Thus God calls by his Providences.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes God calls by his Ordinances,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45968:16"/>
reading the Scriptures, and the Labours of his faithful Miniſters: hearing the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the like. God hath qualified and ſent forth his Miniſters and Meſſengers to call and hire Labourers into his Vineyard, to bid Gueſts to his Wedding-ſupper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. and the beginning. And this is their work which they are ſent about, and is given them in charge, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Go, teach all nations, baptizing — Teaching them to obſerve what I command you.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſent to the <hi>Gentiles, To open their eyes, to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Chriſt himſelf came and preached for this end, and his Doctrine or Sermon was, <hi>Repent, for the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand,</hi> Matth. 4.17. And <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt came with this meſſage, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. Yea, the Apoſtle tells us that this is the work of every Miniſter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. —<hi>Hath committed to us the word of reconciliation; ſo then, we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt: as if God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> So that every Sermon that the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt preach, is a call and knock from Chriſt to open unto him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes Chriſt calls by the ſecret im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of his Spirit, and convictions of our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45968:16"/>
own Conſciences. Thus we read <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. when they heard the Apoſtles Sermon, <hi>They were pricked at their hearts, and cried out, Men and brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> Here was an inward impulſe of the Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Conſciences, accompanying the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preaching of the Word. Thus God ſecretly opened the Heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> to attend to what was preached by <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16.14. And thus the Jaylor was wrought upon by the Spirit of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.29, 30, 31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſecret impulſe of the Spirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Conſcience ſinners many times have when they are going on in their ſins, though they do not always give heed and hearken to it. And this many times the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have, when they begin to be lazy, drowzy, and to fall aſleep in ſecurity: and therefore the Apoſtle bids us not to quench or grieve the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. And indeed the two former ways of Chriſt his knocking and calling are ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, unleſs they be accompanied with this laſt way of calling: For neither Ordinances nor Providences can awaken ſinners, unleſs the Spirit of God work by them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he firſt <hi>binds them in Cords,</hi> and then <hi>opens their ears to diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45968:17"/>
               <p n="4">4. The next thing to be enquired into, is, For what end Chriſt knocks and calls: or what it is which Chriſt would have when he knocks? And to this I anſwer,</p>
               <p>In general, That the end or reaſon of Chriſts knocks and calls are various, according to the different ſtate and conditions of thoſe, at the doors of whoſe Heart he calls. But uſually when he calls, he would have, or deſignes one or more of theſe ends or things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To awaken ſinners out of their deep ſleep in ſin and ſecurity. Sinners are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo faſt aſleep, in ſuch a dead ſleep of ſin and ſecurity, that nothing leſs than the voice of the Son of God knocking and ſpeaking at the door of their Hearts will awaken them: hence we read <hi>John</hi> 5.25. That <hi>the time is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> Which muſt be meant not of a natural Death, or of the day of Reſurrection, but of a Death in ſin; becauſe he ſaith, the time <hi>now is.</hi> And therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You hath he quickned,</hi> i. e. by the powerful voice of his Spirit, <hi>Who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> Would you ſee what one of Chriſt's calls are in this caſe? read <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life.</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45968:17"/>
This he ſpeaks not onely to the Ear by his Word, but to the Heart by his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt his calls at the doors of our hearts many times deſigne Repentance. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a Goſpel-duty incumbent upon every perſon, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>But now commands all men every where to repent.</hi> And for this end he ſends forth his Miniſters to preach the Doctrine of Repentance, to ſhew the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Repentance, and that there is great reaſon or cauſe for Repentance; becauſe we have ſinned, and thereby departed from God, and cannot come to him again but by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is called <hi>The Doctrine of Repentance,</hi> becauſe Repentance is properly a Goſpel-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, a Doctrine that the Law preacheth not: for the Law, or Covenant of Works, admits of no Repentance; but upon our breach of the Law, immediately pronounceth a Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> But the Goſpel-covenant admits of, yea calls for Repentance, as the way and means to obtain Mercy: yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth Mercy and Pardon upon our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſin, ſhall find mercy.</hi> Therefore the Goſpel tells us, that <hi>Except we repent, we ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luke 13 5. If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45968:18"/>
be in a ſtate of unregeneracy, then Chriſt knocks by his Word, and by his Providences, by his Mercies; and his buſineſs with them is, to ſhew that there is a neceſſity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that they muſt either repent, or periſh everlaſtingly. If perſons be in a ſtate of regeneracy, and have by ſome temptation or other lapſed or fallen into Sin; or, it may be, have ſome Sin lodging in them, not yet truely diſcovered, and conſequently not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly repented of: Then and in ſuch caſe Chriſt calls to renewed and enlarged acts of Repentance; for Repentance is a grace that concerns us all our lives long: And therefore the calls of Chriſt in this caſe may be ſuch as theſe: <hi>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt calls to reconciliation with God. When Chriſt comes to the door of thine Heart, he comeS as a mediator and peace-maker, to make peace between God and thy Soul, which are at variance with each other; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin have an utter enmity againſt each other. The cauſe of this enmity Chriſt hath taken away by his death upon the Croſs, and nailed it to his Croſs: The cauſe being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he comes and calls to intreat that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity it ſelf may be taken away, and we would be <hi>reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45968:18"/>
Though there be little reaſon for it, yet man is hard to be wooed and perſwaded to caſt out of his heart the enmity that is lodged there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and his way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And therefore Chriſt is forced to knock and call again and again, before we will (in this caſe) be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to yield to his ſuit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt calls for a cloſure with himſelf by Faith, as the onely way and means to obtain peace, and reconcilation with God. We by our Sins are indebted to God, more than ever we are able to pay: are therefore in danger to be arreſted by Divine Juſtice, and caſt into priſon, where we may lie and rot, to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Jeſus Chriſt ſeeing us in this miſery and diſtreſs, comes and calls at the door of our hearts, offers to be our Surety to pay every farthing of our debt for us; and that upon this condition only, that he may have our full and free conſent to do this for us; and that we will accept of with thankfulneſs what kindneſs he ſhews herein, and rely upon him for the perfecting of this work for us; and where-ever Juſtice ſhall lay any charge or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation againſt us, we will by Faith confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and ſtedfaſtly plead his Satisfaction for our Diſcharge. This is all that he requires from us; and upon this condition only, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to pay our Debt, reconcile us to God,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45968:19"/>
free us from impriſonment, and ſeal us an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and full diſcharge, that ſhall for ever ſtand good to all intents and purpoſes. And therefore Chriſt his calls in this caſe are ſuch as theſe, Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Iſai. 55.1. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, every one that thirſts, come unto the waters, and he that hath no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come and buy wine and milk without money, and without price.</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>Let him that is athirſt come: and whoſoever will, let him take of the waters of life freely:</hi> and he aſſures us, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. that <hi>As many as receive him</hi> (upon theſe terms) <hi>to them he will give power to become the ſons of God: to them that</hi> thus <hi>believe on his Name.</hi> And ſurely one would think this call is worthy to be embraced, with all readineſs of heart and thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt calls to ſincere and hearty obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his commands, and ſubjection to his revealed Will and Law: he calls to <hi>take his yoke upon us, and learn of him,</hi> Mat. 11.29. This call is like unto that of <hi>Boaz</hi> to his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. Buy <hi>Naomi</hi>'s inheritance: but know alſo that thou muſt buy it of <hi>Ruth; i. e.</hi> buy the inheritance, but thou muſt take her to be thy wife alſo, to raiſe up ſeed to thy kinſman that is dead. So ſaith our Saviour,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45968:19"/>
Come, and take the inheritance that I have purchaſed for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and thou art freely wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to it; but know, that in the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engage to behave thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as a loyal, faithful and obedient wife to me; thou muſt take me wholly, as I am, onely, abſolutely and everlaſtingly, not only for a Prieſt to make atonement for thy Sins, and to ſanctifie and offer thy gifts to the Father; but as a Prophet, to teach thee ſuch Laws. Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as are fit and requiſite for thee to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: and as a King, to rule and govern thee by my Law: Thy heart muſt be my Throne, and there muſt I ſit, and exerciſe my Authority, and have thy whole man at command. This Chriſt calls for: but alas! too many that (like <hi>Boaz</hi> his Kinſman) have a mind of the benefit and inheritance, yet here turn their backs, and will rather let the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance go to another, than they will take Chriſt with it: Many will have Chriſt his Crown, but few will take up his Croſs: and therefore Chriſt his calls are but ſlowly heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to in this reſpect.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt calls ſometimes to awaken and excite his Spouſe, when ſhe is dull and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh in her work: ſometimes the hearts of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45968:20"/>
Gods own people grow lazy and ſluggiſh, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laying aſide their ſpiritual work, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it lazily. If they pray, they pray heartleſsly and careleſly, as if they mattered not whether they ſped or not. If they read or hear, they do it in too formal and cuſtomary a manner, not ſtudying to profit thereby. If they come to the Lords Table, they come not with that appetite, and enlarged deſire and expectation that they ſhould; though indeed their wants are many and great, yet if God ſhould put the ſame queſtion to them, that he did to <hi>Elijah, What doſt thou here Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah?</hi> it would be hard for them to give a clear and particular anſwer, or a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being there. They have Sins enough to repent of, but yet the ſight of Chriſt bleeding and dying doth but little move or affect them: They can look upon him whom they have pierced, and yet mourn but little over him; they can behold what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, out of pure love to them, and yet have little ſtirrings of Joy and Thankfulneſs in their hearts. And as for their ſpiritual watch, they let that fall, though in their enemies country; and hereby they give advantage and opportunity to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to tempt them, and take them in his net. Therefore that careful and faithful Captain of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45968:20"/>
our Salvation, ſeeing in what danger we are, not only in regard of our enemies watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in regard of our lazy and ſluggiſh poſture, which indiſpoſeth us for our work, and gives advantage to our adverſary; he therefore calls upon us to awaken us, and quicken us to our watch, and to our work: to our watch, leſt our enemy come and take us napping; and to our work, left the night come before our work be perfected. It is a manifeſt token of Chriſt his care and faithfulneſs, thus to knock and call by awakening Ordinances or Providences, when thus he finds us enclined to ſloath, or ſluggiſhneſs: and yet many times he is forced to call aloud before he can make us hear.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Chriſt calls to open to him, and take part with him of that rich feaſt, or banquet, which he hath prepared and brings with him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers knowing their abſolute dependance upon Chriſt for continual ſupply of grace and comfort, they make their requeſt to Chriſt, that he would come and make a feaſt in their Souls; that he would fill their hearts with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight their heart, whatever other thoughts may trouble and cumber them: and hereupon Chriſt comes and knocks for opening and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, ſaying, (as in the Text) <hi>Open to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45968:21"/>
me, my Siſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled</hi>— and promiſing, as Rev. 3.20. <hi>If any man will open to me, I will come in, and will ſup with him, and he ſhall ſup with me.</hi> Chriſt would not looſe his feaſt when he hath prepared it, nor doth he love <hi>to eat his morſels alone;</hi> but deſires the company of his Spouſe, for whom he hath prepared them; and therefore calls. This was the caſe in the Text. The Spouſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. of the foregoing Chapter, had prayed for the revival of Grace in her heart, that ſhe might be prepared to receive and entertain Chriſt; and being ſo fixed, begs his company. This requeſt is granted, for Chriſt according to her requeſt comes, and deſires to have the door opened to him: when Chriſt comes with loads of comfort, he many times findes the door of the heart faſt ſhut againſt him, long knocks and calls before he gain admiſſion. The Promiſes and Comforts of Chriſt ſtand many times long at the doors of our hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we open to, and receive them by faith; and many an excuſe and put-off will many a poor ſoul make againſt it ſelf, before it will be perſwaded to receive the promiſes for its own comfort; yea ſometimes ſo compliment it, and plead excuſes, till Chriſt in an ange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> withdraw, and make the Soul long, and with an aking heart to ſeek Chriſt in the promiſes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45968:21"/>
before ſhe find him. And this (I conceive) is not the leaſt part of the Holy Ghoſts deſign to diſcover in this Text.</p>
               <p>And thus have I ſhewed you ſome of thoſe things which Chriſt would have when he knocks and calls. The laſt thing in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Doctrine, is to ſhew what are the ſpecial times of Chriſt his knocking and calling.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer in general, That there is no Diſpenſation of God that he exerciſeth towards us, but it hath ſomething of a call from God in it. Every Ordinance of God, is a call from God, and comes with ſome Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage unto us. Meſſengers are not ſent, but upon ſome meſſage or errand. God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are his Meſſengers, ſent unto us, with ſome word of Reproof, Inſtruction, Counſel, or Comfort. And therefore the Scriptures are ſaid to be <hi>Profitable for Doctrine, Reproof, Correction, and Inſtruction in righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 13.16. And it is God's word that his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers bring, and therefore their meſſage is to be heeded, becauſe it is a call or meſſage from God. Every ſecret impulſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, check, and conviction of thy Conſcience, is a call from God, ought to be liſtened and hearkned to; for Conſcience is God's Deputy or Vice-gerent in the ſoul. Every Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45968:22"/>
that befals thee, whether Mercy beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon thee, or Affliction, is a Meſſenger ſent from God, and hath ſomething of a call in it, ſomething that God would have thee to learn by it. Yea, even thoſe common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, whether of good or evil, that befal thee in common with others, they come with ſome particular meſſage to thee. A packet of Letters may be brought to a Town or place by one common Poſt or Carrier, but every ones Letter in particular comes about his own ſpecial buſineſs, though it come by the hand of the common Carrier. So in common Afflictions or Judgements, though they come in a common way, and by a common hand, either Humane or Divine, or in a common way of Providence; yet they come upon a particular errand, and about particular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the particular perſons to whom they are ſent. If they come to thee, know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they have ſome particular meſſage to thee from Heaven; and therefore labour to underſtand the Voice, and learn the Leſſon. But though there be ſomething of a call from God in every paſſage of God's carriage towards us, yet there are ſome ſpecial times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God's calls are much more remarkable: and it would be of dangerous conſequence to ſlight ſuch calls, or let ſlip ſuch opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45968:22"/>
And they are ſuch times as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt his knocks and calls are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable under powerful Ordinances, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſecret ſtrivings of the Spirit, and convictions of our own Conſciences. God qualifies and ſends forth his Miniſters to preach the Goſpel unto thoſe to whom he ſends them, and hath promiſed to be <hi>with them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, even to the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28.19, 20. It is his work they are about, and they muſt have his aſſiſtance and direction in the Work. He muſt put words into their Mouths, ſuch as may accompliſh the end and errand for which he ſends them to ſuch perſons or people. And hence it is, that the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Servants of Chriſt, are not onely diverſly gifted and qualified for their work; but they find the Spirit of God variouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, aſſiſting, reſtraining, or enlarging, according as God is pleaſed to make uſe of them, and call them forth upon ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular work and deſigne. There is ſcarce a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt but may obſerve this in himſelf by frequent experience, both in his private Studies, and publick Exerciſes. Now when God doth by his Spirit in a more than ordinary manner raiſe, enlarge, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Servants in their ſtudies; warming the Word upon their Hearts; and likewiſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45968:23"/>
inliven, and enlarge, and warm them in their publick work, and at the ſame time the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is buſie at work, ſtriving with the people to whom this Meſſage is ſent, by ſecret impulſes of his Spirit, and convictions of their Conſciences; doubtleſs this is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable call from Chriſt, and it would be of dangerous conſequence to let ſlip ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, to ſtifle ſuch Convictions, and to quench ſuch motions of the Spirit. An emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inſtance we have of this, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. where we have <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> inwardly <hi>preſſed in his Spirit,</hi> v. 5. and therefore warmed in his work: and the ſame Spirit was alſo buſie at work in the Hearts of his hearers; for <hi>many believed,</hi> v. 8. God encourageth him, and bids him not fear, but go on boldly with his work, and he will be with him, and defend him: And the reaſon was, becauſe God had <hi>much people in that City,</hi> v. 9, 10. This was a remarkable time of Chriſt his calling: and the <hi>Jews</hi> oppoſing the Apoſtle, and rejecting this call, proved of dreadful conſequence to them, <hi>v.</hi> 6. for the Apoſtle left them, and preached to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> When Chriſt by his Spirit really warms the Heart of the Miniſter in his work, and withal ſends his Spirit to open thine Ears to attend, to enlighten thy Underſtanding to apprehend, to convince thy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45968:23"/>
Judgment of the truth of what is ſpoken, and to awake thy Conſcience, and make thy Bowels to ſtir within thee, as here he did the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.4, 5. this is a ſpecial call from Chriſt; and take heed how thou reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it, or letteſt it ſlip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt his Knocks and Calls are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, under ſpecial and remarkable Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The more eminent and remarkable God's Providences are towards them, the more loud and conſiderable are his calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee. As for inſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Under viſible danger of Chriſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval or withdrawing. If Chriſt ſhew ſigns and tokens of removing, it is to correct our former negligence, and to quicken us to lay faſter hold upon him. Thus in this Chapter, whereof the Text is part, the Spouſe did but too much ſlight Chriſt, in that ſhe was ſo lazy that ſhe would not ariſe to let him in; and therefore he withdrew, and made her ſeek him ſorrowing, with an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aking Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> and guilty ſelf-condemning conſcience, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe could finde him. Upon this account it is that Chriſt's departure from a perſon or people is many times gradual. He doth not depart on a ſudden, but by ſteps and degrees; that every ſtep may be a motive to lay hold upon Chriſt before he be quite gone. Thus
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45968:24"/>
we find he departed from the Temple of old, as is evident in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s viſion, <hi>chapter</hi> 10.11. The glory of God firſt removed to the door of the houſe, from thence to the Mountain, and then quite away. If we have any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with God, it is high time to improve our preſent oportunity, when God tells us by ſignes and tokens that he is removing, and ready to be gone. There is a wo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls upon that perſon or people from whom God departs, when he is gone, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.12. <hi>Wo unto them when I depart from them.</hi> And therefore the ſignes of God's departure muſt needs be ſtrong alarms to cauſe us ſpeedily to lay hold upon God before he depart. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is neer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When God hath for ſome time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf, and afterward for ſome little ſpace hath returned again, and manifeſted his preſence or nearneſs: this is a loud call to improve our time, and while it is called to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day, to hearken, and not harden our hearts. We read in the parable of the barren Fig-tree, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that when the owner had come ſeveral years expecting fruit, and found none, he commands that the Tree be <hi>cut down,</hi> becauſe it but <hi>cumbred the ground:</hi> but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45968:24"/>
at the requeſt and interceſſion of his Servant he ſpares it <hi>one year longer,</hi> and takes more pains with it that year than he had done of other years before; and if then it bear not fruit, it muſt be cut down without remedy. If after our many years barrenneſs in God's Orchard, and his threatning to cut us down, he takes more than ordinary pains with us, by his Word, Meſſengers, and Spirit, ſeeming more eminently and viſibly to return to us for ſome ſpace, to dig about us, and dung us: this is a loud call from him to improve the preſent opportunity, leſt he cut us down, and there be no ſervant to ſtand in the gap, or ſpeak a word for us. God's Miniſters are his Husbandmen; and if God threaten to cut down any Tree, they cry out, Lord ſpare it a little longer, let us take a littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more pains with it; and if then it will not be fruitful, we will hold our peace: and if hereupon God do for ſome time ſpare, and yet no fruit be brought forth, that Tree will be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be curſed, and devoted to the fire. If once God ſay to his Miniſters as once he did to <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Jer. 7.16. <hi>Pray not thou for this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither lift up prayer nor cry, for I will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45968:25"/>
it ſlip, leſt God ſwear in his wrath, that we ſhall not enter into his reſt. We finde that good and publick-ſpirited man, <hi>Ezra,</hi> chap. 9. v. 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſadly trembling and aſtoniſhed at ſuch a thing as this: God had puniſhed his people by a ſeventy years Captivity for their ſins: and now for a little time grace had been ſhewed to them from the Lord, to give them a nail in his Sanctuary, and ſome tokens of his favour, and viſible preſence; but now they begin to fall to their old courſe of ſinning, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improve this day of grace: this makes <hi>Ezra</hi> to tremble, and ſit down aſtoniſhed. And ſee what he ſaith in his Prayer to God, verſ. 13. <hi>If after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds ſeeing that thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſt than our iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch deliverance as this: ſhould we again brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45968:25"/>
the Pſalmiſt makes this a ſtrong argument to his ſoul to return to his God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto thy reſt (i. e.</hi> unto thy God, for God is the only true and perfect reſt of the Soul) <hi>O my ſoul: for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.</hi> And if in this caſe thou ſhut him out, or turn a deaf ear to his call, the greater will be thy ſin: we finde therefore the Spirit of God often aggravating the ſins of men from this conſideration; as in the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> 12. when he had ſinned in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> God ſends <hi>Nathan</hi> to him, who thus ſpeaks to him from the Lord, ver. 7, 8, 9. <hi>I anointed thee king over Iſrael: and I delivered thee from the hand of</hi> Saul: <hi>I gave thee thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters houſe, and thy maſters wives into thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and gave thee the houſe of Iſrael and of Judah: And if that had been too little, I would moreover have given thee ſuch and ſuch things: wherefore then haſt thou deſpiſed the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, to do evil in his ſight?</hi> — This made <hi>David</hi>'s ſin wonderfully great; and ſo is it a moſt ſad aggravation of any mans ſin: See how God pleads with his Church, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. upon this account, <hi>Do you thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord?</hi> Why, what had God done for them? See <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, &amp;c. he had <hi>choſe them for his portion:</hi> His Providence had been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful about them, his Preſence had been
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45968:26"/>
wonderfully with them, and his Goodneſs had been wonderful towards them; and that therefore they ſhould grow fat and kick, was an heinous and intolerable affront, and would be dreadful in the iſſue, and therefore wiſheth <hi>that they would be wiſe to conſider their later end:</hi> let us therefore think of this, whom God hath ſo (every way) loaded with bleſſings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſts calls are remarkable, when his judgments are terrible; when the terribleneſs of Gods Judgments do manifeſt the heat of Gods wrath, then it is high time to know <hi>the voice of the rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi> We read <hi>Amos</hi> 4. God threatens to <hi>draw them forth with fiſh-hooks,</hi> and caſt them out of their own land, becauſe of their incorrigible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under his Judgments: he had ſo and ſo puniſhed them for their ſins, and yet they had not returned to the Lord, and therefore he would do thus with them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. And what follows? (mark) <hi>And becauſe I will do thus unto thee, therefore prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> This was a loud call, without any more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays to prepare to meet God. The ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet puts this queſtion in the Negative, which the more ſtrongly affirms, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the people not be afraid?</hi> When Gods Judgments ſound as a Trumpet of an Enemy that hath taken
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45968:26"/>
the City, it is high time for the people to tremble.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When the meaning of Gods dealings with us is plainly and legibly written in the forehead of Gods diſpenſations towards us, the more loud and intelligible is his call. When the finger of God in his Providences plainly points at our carriages, eaſie to be read and underſtood, this makes the call more clear, and us the more inexcuſable if we take not notice of it. Sometimes a man may plainly read his ſin that God ſmites at, in his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as <hi>David</hi> might read his ſin of Adultery and Murder, in <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Rebellion, and lying with his Concubines. Sometimes Judgments put ſuch a ſtop to us in our ſin, and take away the very occaſion of our ſins, or the things whereby we ſin, that we may plainly ſee God correcting ſuch a ſin in us. Sometimes again, the circumſtances of the puiſhment clearly point at the cauſe of them, as here in the Text. Chriſt his immediate departure, after the Spouſe her complemental excuſe and refulal to open to him, did moſt clearly point out her ſin to her, and (no queſtion) was a moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and biting ſting upon her Conſcience. Sometimes there comes ſecret convictions and intimations of the cauſe of Gods cotroverſie, along with the affliction. God whiſpers us in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45968:27"/>
the ear, and tells us that ſuch a laſh and ſcourge is for ſuch a fault; and when theſe things fall out thus, they are loud calls from Chriſt to hearken to Inſtruction, and to bow our ear to Diſcipline. That ſaying of <hi>Elihu</hi> is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for this purpoſe, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>If they be bound in fetters, and holden in cords of affliction: Then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſion, that they have exceeded. He openeth their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth them to depart from iniquity. If they obey and ſerve him, then they ſhall ſpend their days in proſperity, and their years in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But if they obey not, they ſhall periſh by the ſword, and ſhall dye without knowledge.</hi> And therefore it muſt needs be of dangerous conſequence, to turn the deaf ear to ſuch a loud call as this is. Thus remarkable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences are a loud call from Chriſt to open to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt his calls are remarkable, when he comes upon our calling and invitation; when we from a ſenſe of his abſence have earneſtly begged for his coming, and he in anſwer to our prayers doth come, and ſtands knocking at the doors of our hearts for admiſſion and entertainment; this call is very loud, and our refuſal to open, would be moſt unworthy. This is the very caſe in the Text, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45968:27"/>
I need not multiply Texts or Inſtances about it, for the caſe is plain enough here. The Spouſe had prayed that Chriſt would come into the garden of her heart; Chriſt makes no delay, but quickly comes, and might reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect to find ready admiſſion, being ſo earneſtly invited; but contrary to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he finds her in bed, the door ſhut, and ſhe too lazy to ariſe to open to him; and therefore he withdraws in a diſcontent, as well he might. If therefore upon our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayer Chriſt come and knock at the door of our hearts, either by his Ordinances or Providences, let us not ſtand debating whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall let him in or not, whatever po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture we be in, though naked in our bed: for this is a ſpecial time of his coming, and will be unkindly taken, if he finde not admiſſion according to his invitation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When Chriſt his calls are accompanied with a great deal of earneſtneſs and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. When Chriſt is in ſo very good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, that he woes and intreats, and will take no denial; this is a loud, becauſe an earneſt call, and argues that he is come very nigh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the very door. Therefore the Prophet adviſeth by all means to cloſe with ſuch an opportunity as this, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45968:28"/>
he is neer.</hi> This was the caſe of the Spouſe in the Text. Chriſt was come to her door, and not onely ſtood there knocking, but by all the friendly compellations imaginable, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to perſwade her to let him in: <hi>Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled.</hi> And when this will not do, he comes near to the door, and puts in his finger by the hole of the door, as though he would make a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible entry; intimating his earneſt deſire to have admiſſion: and therefore it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly done of her to keep him out, and coſt her dear before he did come in. And ſo it may be with thee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When Chriſt his Locks are wet with the dews of the night, then are his calls earneſt and importunate, and it will be of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to keep him out. This is the argument which Chriſt makes uſe of in the Text, <hi>Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</hi> Many things may be included in this argument, and all of force to perſwade her to let him in; and making the argument more ſtrong and forcible, make the call to be ſo much the louder, and the denial the more unreaſonable. The words may be taken in a good ſenſe: <hi>My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45968:28"/>
i. e. I come full fraught with all manner of Bleſſings and Benefits, that may tend to the chearing, refreſhing, and fructifying of thy ſpiritual man. There is nothing wanting in me to make thee perfectly and every way hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; onely <hi>open to me,</hi> and let me in: and then thou ſhalt be made partaker of all that is mine, and all that is in me. What is not wanting in me, ſhall not be wanting to thee, onely <hi>open to me</hi> by Faith, and let me in. And the truth is, all our emptineſs and penury ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not from any want or defect in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in him all fulneſs dwels;</hi> but from our ſelves, becauſe we open not to him. And thus underſtood, they are an anſwer to the Spouſe her prayer, <hi>Chapter</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake, O north wind, and come thou ſouth, and breath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out.</hi> She prays for the breathings of the Spirit, whereby her Graces might be revived, and made more active, and odoriferou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. And to this Chriſt anſwers, that the onely way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this in the extent and fulneſs of it, is to open to him by Faith, and let him into the Heart; and if ſhe will do ſo, he aſſures her that he brings all fulneſs of grace and bleſſings with him, his very head and locks are filled with them; and ſurely this is a moſt full and convincing argument,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45968:29"/>
being applied as an anſwer to her prayer, and might well have the force of a loud call in her ears, ſufficient to raiſe her, though laid down to take her eaſe. But the words may alſo be taken in a bad ſenſe, importing the miſery and hardſhip which Chriſt had undergone in coming to her in ſo dark and wet a night, and that ſtill he did endure by ſtanding out of doors in the wet, and dark, and cold. As if Chriſt had ſaid, O my deareſt Spouſe! thou, by thy prayer, which ſo lately thou didſt ſend to me, didſt importune my company and help; and out of that true affection which I have for thee, and commiſeration of thy condition, I have undertaken this long and tedious Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, wherein I am benighted; the way hath been very foul, (for I have trodden the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of God's wrath alone, have endured much perſecution in my own perſon, and the perſons of my Miniſters, and much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of ſinners againſt my ſelf; it hath coſt me my deareſt hearts blood to make my way to thee) and the weather hath been very wet, ſtormy, and tempeſtuous, ſo that I am wet to the very skin, not a dry hair upon my head, and the night hath been and is very dark, ſo dark, that it made me cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and now I am come, I ſtand at thy door in this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45968:29"/>
miſerable wet and weary condition, deſiring entrance and admiſſion: Therefore open to me; and though thou be in thy warm bed, and at eaſe, yet conſider what a ſad condition I am in, and how bad and dangerous it is for my health to ſtand here in this condition; and do not ſo far forget thy relation to me, thy late requeſt, the pains and hardſhip which I have endured, and do endure, and the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Affection which thou oughteſt to bear unto me, as to ſuffer me to ſtand here out of doors, but ariſe quickly and open to me. If thou haſt any pity or commiſeration in thine heart, ſhew it now to me thy beloved Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And what could be ſaid more, to make the argument preſſing and cogent? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs have the force of a loud, a powerful, and irreſiſtable call.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with the Explication; and now follows the proof and confirmation of the Doctrine; That to be lazy and ſecure, when Chriſt calls and knocks, may be of very dangerous conſequence; eſpecially when his coming and calling is in anſwer to our Prayers, as you ſee here it was in the Text. The truth of which will manifeſtly appear, from theſe following Conſiderations.</p>

At laſt Chriſt yields, conſents, and (laying aſide all other buſineſs) comes, little queſtioning but to finde us in a readineſs to receive him; or however, willing to open to him when he knocks and calls, in regard we have ſo earneſtly invited him. Therefore now at his coming to finde the doors ſhut, we ſo careleſs of his company as not to watch for him one hour; and when he knocks and calls, for us to anſwer, <hi>I have put off my coats how ſhall I put them on?

Well may Chriſt then take this ingratitude and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation unkindly from her, and take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hereupon to depart. If any of you ſhould invite a friend to your houſe, and according to your earneſt invitation your friend comes, but at his coming you ſhut the doors againſt him; and though you be within, yet you refuſe to open to him, may he not well take this piece of ingratitude and mockery unkindly at your hands, and look upon it as an high affront put upon him, and therefore depart in a rage, and reſolve to miſs your door the next time he comes that way?

When ſhe aroſe to open to her beloved, he had withdrawn himſelf, and was gone. Chriſt had heard and anſwered her at her firſt call: but ſince ſhe had dealt ſo deceitfully and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingeniouſly with him, ſhe ſhould now call and call again before he gave her any anſwer, ſhould ſeek and ſeek him ſorrowing before ſhe ſhould finde him. She was but now ſo lazy, eaſeful, and delicate, that ſhe could not abide to be at ſo much pains as to put on her Coat, having put it off; could not endure ſo much hardſhip as to tread upon the floor with her naked foot, leſt ſhe ſhould defile it: But if Chriſt be ſo little ſtore ſet by, her love to Chriſt ſhall be further tried; ſhe ſhall take a longer Journey, and not complain ſo much of the ſoulneſs of the way neither before ſhe finde him. If it be ſo tedious a Journey to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45968:32"/>
croſs the houſe-floor, Chriſt will ſee whether ſhe will take a journey through the ſtreets, and high-ways, in as dark and foul way and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he hath come, before ſhe finde him; that ſo ſhe may know ſomething of what he hath endured in coming to her, and may now readily open to him the next time. And therefore it is of dangerous conſequence to ſhut out Chriſt, when he knocks and calls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the benefits and bounties which Chriſt brings with him into the Soul that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to, and entertains him: Our Saviour ſaith, Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock; if any man open to me, I will come in unto him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> If Chriſt will make a Feaſt unto the Soul that lets him in, it muſt needs be ill to keep him out. The Soul hath no ſuch ſtore of proviſion within her ſelf, as to deſpiſe the Feaſts which Chriſt will make her. In the Text Chriſt makes uſe of this Argument to move her to open the door, <hi>For my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night:</hi> which being taken in a good ſenſe, (as was noted before) intimates the fulneſs of Bleſſings and Benefits which Chriſt comes loaden with, when he deſires entrance into the Soul.

Chriſt in coming. Chriſt is the eternal Son of God, and Heir of all things; he is the King of Glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>His Throne is in Heaven: His Kingdom is over all: He is God bleſſed for ever;</hi> needs not thee to adde any thing to his happineſs. It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion in him to behold the things that are done in Heaven, much more to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any earthly creature. And yet this King of Kings, and Lord of Lords comes to thy poor, ſootty, beggarly Cottage; knocks at the door of thy Heart, deſires admiſſion and entertainment there, and will be content either with ſuch as he findes, or ſuch as he brings. For thee therefore to ſhut out this King of Glory, is a moſt inexcuſable affront. Let me illuſtrate theſe two Arguments, of our unworthyneſs, and Chriſt his condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by this ſimilitude.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the greateſt King or Emperor in the world ſhould meet a poor, naked, naſty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Beggar, nothing but Dirt and Lice; not a rag to cover her nakedneſs, not a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of bread to put in her mouth, not a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to put her head in, not a penny in her purſe, but more in debt than ſhe and all her friends in the world are able to pay, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt out of her houſe and harbour, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the bare Dunghil to lie upon, naked,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45968:35"/>
whatever weather come, and ſo our of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as that none would pity her, or let her come in: This great Emperor caſts his eye upon her, pities her condition, ſets his love upon her, promiſeth that if ſhe will take him for her Husband, he will pay her debts for her, procure her a diſcharge, will marry her, and make her his Bride or Queen, waſh away all her filthyneſs, deck and adorn her with all coſtly Jewels and Raiment ſuitable to the quality and degree of ſuch a perſons wife as himſelf is, and that there ſhall be nothing wanting to make her happy: Hereupon the match is concluded, and he owns her for his Spouſe, decks and adorns her according to promiſe, puts clothes upon her back rich and coſtly, and money in her purſe; yet takes her not for the preſent home to his Court and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, but leaves her a while in her ſmoaky Cottage: ſhe pretending love to him, thinks his abſence long, and therefore ſends to him to intreat his company: ſuch is the ardour of his affection, that he comes without delay, though the weather be wet and ſtormy, the way foul and deep, the night dark, and the Journey tedious; findes her in bed, the doors ſhut, and therefore knocks and calls, ſaying, Open to me, my deareſt Spouſe, for I am come at thy requeſt, though I have not a dry hair
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45968:35"/>
upon my head, or thread upon my back; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore open to me, and let me in: And ſhe ſhould ſay, I am gone to bed, I cannot get up, I cannot take ſo much pains now as to put on my coat, I am compoſing my ſelf for reſt, have waſhed my feet, have no minde to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file or dirty them with coming over the floor; and therefore if you would have come in, you ſhould have come ſooner. Suppoſe all this, would this anſwer be well taken? might not this be of dangerous conſequence to this proud beggar, and give juſt occaſion to blaſt all her hopes? Have I undervalued my ſelf thus (may the King ſay) to advance a proud beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and doth ſhe ſerve me thus? But I will leave her in the condition I found her, and come no more at her. This is the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jeſus Chriſt and his Spouſe; nay, there cannot be that inequality between the higheſt Prince in the world and the meaneſt Beggar, that there is between Jeſus Chriſt and his Spouſe. And therefore we may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, of how dangerous conſequence it may be, to ſhut out Jeſus Chriſt when he knocks and calls, eſpecially when his coming is in anſwer to our Prayers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider the great wrong which we do to Jeſus Chriſt, if we do not open to him at his call. The wrong that will fall upon Chriſt,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45968:36"/>
by our not opening to him, is ſet down in the Text, in theſe words, <hi>For my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night;</hi> which words (as we told you before) may be taken in a bad ſenſe as well as a good, denoting the miſery, ſufferings, and afflictions, that Jeſus Chriſt endures, in making way, and coming unto his people: in which words I would obſerve (1.) the great pains which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt had taken to come; ſuch was the length and tediouſneſs of the way, ſo many obſtructions and lets, ſo many difficulties and hardſhips, that he was benighted, and it was got very late when he came: and therefore pity to let him ſtand any longer wet and weary. Oh, what haſte would a loving Wife make to ariſe and open to her Husband, in ſuch a caſe as this is! And if ſhe did not, her Husband might well take it unkindly at her hands: And yet the Spouſe here makes an Apology, <hi>I have put off my coat,</hi> &amp;c. Such carriage as this may well cauſe him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is mention made of Drops and Dews of the night; which ſeem to denote Afflictions, and Sufferings, and Hardſhips; for ſo we finde them made uſe of in Scripture: when <hi>Jacob</hi> would ſet forth what hardſhip he endured with his Father-in-law <hi>Laban,</hi> in his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45968:36"/>
ſervice, he ſaith, Gen. 31.40. <hi>In the day the drought conſumed me, and the froſts by night.</hi> Afflictions in many places are compared to the Night; and ſo they may well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood here, eſpecially conſidering how wet and ſtormy a night it was. And truely Jeſus Chriſt had very ſtormy weather to come to his Spouſe: we read in Scripture what hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips he met with in the way. See how Chriſt himſelf complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.23. <hi>He hath weakned my ſtrength in the way, he hath ſhortned my days.</hi> He met with the ſtorms of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath, which made him to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The ſtorm was ſo bitter, that he prays, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me:</hi> and yet <hi>it pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him, and make his ſoul an offering for ſin: He bare our griefs, and carried our ſorrows; the chaſtiſement of our peace was laid upon his ſhoulders, and with his ſtripes we were healed: yet we accounted him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted.</hi> He endured hardſhip not only from enemies, but from friends; and therefore ſaith, <hi>Theſe were the wounds which I received in the houſe of my friends,</hi> Zech. 13.6. And ſurely this was a ſtormy night; that the Spouſe therefore ſhould deny him entrance ſuch a night as this was, eſpecially when he had endured all this for her
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45968:37"/>
ſake, that he might come to her, was great unkindneſs, and might well provoke him to withdraw.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His urging this argument ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the great prejudice that might come to him by her delay, and making him to ſtand wet and weary there. The force of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſeems to lie here, and he thus argues: O my Spouſe, I have undertaken a very ſad and weariſome Journey for thy ſake; I am at laſt (though late) come in a weary, wet, and dropping condition to the door, it may be very prejudicial to my health to ſtand long here in this condition I am in: as thou pitieſt my life and health, and haſt any reſpect for me, open and let me in, and ſuffer me not to ſtand here and catch my death. What more forcible argument could be made uſe of to a Wiſe that hath any real reſpect for her Husband? and yet in this ſluggiſh humour ſhe tells him, <hi>She hath put off her Coats, and cannot put them on:</hi> ſhe will rather ſuffer her Husband to ſtarve at the door, than ſhe will be at the pains to put on her Coat and let him in.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſuch unkind carriages as theſe, are prejudicial to Chriſt's health, they <hi>wound</hi> and <hi>Crucifie him afreſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. It muſt needs take a deep and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impreſſion upon the heart of Chriſt, to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45968:37"/>
think that this ſhould be the requital of all his ſufferings, and that from the hand of his Spouſe: well may this then cauſe his <hi>Jealouſie to burn,</hi> and cauſe him in a rage to withdraw himſelf. Conſider this, that every denial, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very delay to open to Chriſt, cuts him to the very heart, and doth (as it were) make his pierced heart to bleed afreſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The patience of Chriſt in all his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſeems here to be pointed at alſo. He had not onely watched till he had felt a drop, but drops, yea, till his Head was filled with drops: he was wet to the very skin, not a dry thred, or free place about him, and therefore could endure to ſtay no longer: and therefore ſo earneſtly calls, <hi>Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</hi> To refuſe to open in this caſe, muſt needs be a great wrong to Chriſt, and may coſt us dear, if he ſhould thereupon depart, as juſtly he might, being thus wronged and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted by us. But</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is one thing more in the Call which makes the wrong intolerable; and that is, the place where he calls is his own houſe, the door whereat he knocks is his own door. We told you before, that the place where Chriſt knockt, was at the door of the heart.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45968:38"/>
And the Spouſe had before given her heart to Chriſt; therefore it was his own door that he knocks at, and to his own Spouſe that he calls, <hi>Open to me,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore what an intolerable wrong is here, to keep Chriſt out of his own houſe, to keep his own door lockt againſt him, in ſuch weather, and in ſuch a condition as he was! it is a wonder that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of withdrawing, he did not fire the houſe about her ears, but that he is an infinitely patient Husband. Such carriages as theſe are intolerable wrongs to Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may coſt us dear.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider the earneſt and ſweet perſwa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſives that Chriſt at his coming and knocking makes uſe of to procure his admiſſion. There are three Texts of Scripture which I would pitch upon, from thence to gather the ſweet winning arguments that Chriſt ordinarily makes uſe of, when he knocks and calls at the door of his Spouſe. One is the Text; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Parable of the great Supper at the marriage of the Kings ſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17, &amp;c. and the third is <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. And from theſe Texts I would gather theſe three Arguments, which Chriſt makes uſe of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He wooes and intreats from that nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> relation that is between them. She was his ſiſter and ſpouſe; as if Chriſt ſhould have
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45968:38"/>
ſaid thus: My dear ſiſter and ſpouſe! it is thy dear Brother and Husband, that is come wet and weary to thy door, ſtands here, wet to the very skin, <hi>My head filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</hi> Canſt thou finde in thine heart to lie ſnorting in thy bed, and taking thine eaſe, and hear thy poor afflicted wearied Brother and Husband ſtand without in all this ſtormy weather, knocking and calling, and not take ſo much pains as to come to the door to open to me? Thou needeſt not ſtir a foot out of the doors, but onely come to the door and open it. Haſt thou no more of a ſympathizing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerating ſpirit in thee? Will the nearneſs of our relation work no more upon thee? If I were a ſtranger to thee, I could ſay the leſs for my ſelf; (though common pity ſhould be ſhewed to ſtrangers) but being ſo nearly related to thee, me thinks I ſhould not need to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply words, but might finde preſent admiſſion and ready entertainment: why then doſt thou not come? Now a refuſal or ſlighty neglect in this caſe will ſcarcely be born: the bond of Relation ſhould double the force of the Argument. And therefore unkindneſſes from near relations, are of a more provoking and exaſperating nature, than from other perſons: becauſe better things are expected. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45968:39"/>
to deny to open to Chriſt, when thus he calls, and pleads ſuch an argument as this, muſt needs be highly provoking, and of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He wooes and intreats from the dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and reciprocal affection that was betwixt them: <hi>My Love, my Dove, my undefiled.</hi> Oh, what ſweet compellations! How can theſe be denied? And ſurely Chriſt is in good earneſt, he doth not diſſemble or flatter. Doth <hi>Elihu</hi> ſay, <hi>Job</hi> 32.22. <hi>I know not how to give flattering titles, for in ſo doing my Maker would ſoon take me away?</hi> And do you think that our faithful Lord and Husband Jeſus Chriſt would flatter and diſſemble? Surely, no: He is real there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe ſweet and heart-melting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, which are expreſſions of Love coming from his very heart. <hi>My love, my dove, my undefiled.</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, Thou art ſhe, whoſe heart is joined to mine in moſt ſincere and cordial Affection: I have ſet my love onely upon thee, and have choſen thee out of the world to be my Spouſe, <hi>Have loved thee with an everlaſting love, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee:</hi> and I know that thou haſt a real kindneſs and reſpect for me, and that thou preferreſt my Love <hi>before Wine,</hi> or any thing that can be named: And that in thine eyes (however
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45968:39"/>
contemptible I may be in the eyes of the world) <hi>I am altogether lovely.</hi> Oh therefore let not ſloath and drowzineſs ſo far prevail, and make thee to forget thy love to me, and my love to thee (which I have given thee full and frequent aſſurance of) as to ſuffer me to ſtand here in the wet and cold. And what hard-hearted Wife could reſiſt ſuch a heart-melting Argument as this? Yea thou art <hi>my Dove.</hi> Doves are kind to, and mourn ſore for the abſence of one another: Thy mate, O my Dove! is at the door, and wilt thou not let him in? Yea further, thou art my undefiled, my chaſt Spouſe; I cannot think that thine heart is in the leaſt alienated from me, or ſet upon any other Lover: I am not jealous of thee, and therefore ſhew thy faithfulneſs and loyalty by opening unto me, that I may not have occaſion of jealouſie, left in mine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thy heart ſhould be taken with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lover. If this argument will not work, what may Chriſt think? Would it not then be of dangerous conſequence to do that, which may give occaſion of jealouſie to our Lord and Husband? and therefore the Doctrine muſt needs be true.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He wooes and intreats from the great advantage which his coming in would be unto her. Chriſt ſeldom or never
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45968:40"/>
invites us to our loſs, but we are ſure to be gainers by every duty or work he puts us upon: He tells her here, that <hi>his head was filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night.</hi> Which being taken in a good ſenſe (as was noted before) imports, that Chriſt came full fraught with bleſſings and benefits, not an hair of his head but would afford ſome drop of comfort or benefit, which would make amends for the pains which ſhe ſhould be at, in riſing and opening to him. And if we read Rev. 3.20. he tell us, that <hi>If any man will open unto him, he will come in and ſup with them, and they with him.</hi> There is Emphaſis and weight in every word, he would <hi>come in.</hi> This piece of condeſcention in him, was a ſufficient recompence of her pains; it was a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that ſuch a gueſt ſhould come under her roof. That ſuch a glorious perſon as Chriſt, who is God equal with the Father, and <hi>before whom the very Angels cover their faces with their wings, as not able to behold his Glory.</hi> That ſuch a glorious perſon as this is, ſhould come into ſuch a ſmoaky cottage, as that of mans heart, is wonderful condeſcention, and therefore honour enough put upon the Spouſe, which might abundantly recompence her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in opening to him. But this is not all, he would <hi>come in,</hi> and therefore ſhe (being
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45968:40"/>
within) ſhould have his company, ſtand in his preſence, <hi>In whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> And ſurely his company is no little worth, and that ſhe her ſelf being judge, or elſe wherefore doth ſhe ſo earneſtly pray for it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 16. Fruition is that which Love labours after, and which alone gives ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and reſt to the motion of love. She might now enjoy her beloved, which ſhe had ſo earneſtly panted after, and long looked for: and ſurely her pains in riſing and opening to him could not be ſo great, as to over-weigh the benefit and deſireableneſs of his company. But yet this is not all, he would <hi>ſup with her.</hi> Oh wonderful condeſcention! will the King of Glory take, and be content with ſuch a ſupper as can be provided for him in ſuch a poor beggarly Cottage as man's Heart! is there any diſh there that can pleaſe or give content to him? Have we any thing in our Hearts that will feaſt Chriſt? Oh then open quickly, and let him have it without any delay. For, to be ſure, there is nothing there, that is worth the having, but what is of his own ſending in: and it is no better, if not worſe, for coming through our hands; and therefore ſtick not to let him have it.</p>
               <p>But yet further, he will not onely <hi>ſup with
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45968:41"/>
us,</hi> that is, be refreſhed with the fruitfulneſs and ſweetneſs of our Graces, as is evident <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. but <hi>we ſhall ſup with him,</hi> that is, he will feaſt us with his comforts and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. Chriſt never comes empty handed, but he brings ſuch bleſſings and benefits with him, as by their excellency and ſuitableneſs, will not fail abundantly to refreſh our ſouls, and wherewith <hi>the Soul will be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5, 6. Chriſt never comes in unto any ſoul, that ſincerely opens to him, but he <hi>takes them into his Banqueting houſe, and his banner over them is love: He ſtays them with flaggons, and comforts them with apples,</hi> Cant. 2.4, 5. <hi>He abundantly ſatisfies them with the fatneſs of his houſe, and makes them drink of the river of his pleaſures; for with him is the Fountain of Life, and in his light we ſhall ſee light.</hi> Pſal. 36.8, 9. And will not then Chriſt's Feaſt make amends for our pains in opening to him? But you will ſay, What can Chriſt bring with him in ſuch dark and ſtormy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Read but <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. It is ſupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, <hi>Come, for all things are now ready.</hi> There is no diſh wanting that may make a complea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You ſee therefore what force this argument hath every way to prevail with her to ariſe and open to him; and can we think our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial will be well taken?</p>
               <p>Let me onely adde this conſideration more from this laſt expreſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. <hi>Come, for all things are now ready.</hi> Chriſt hath been at great care and charges to provide a Royal and ſuitable Supper for us, (not ſuitable to our deſerts; for then it would be a miſerable one; but ſuitable to our need and neceſſity) wherein no variety is wanting, that may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nouriſh us, or truely ſatisfie us, and make us happy; and all things are now prepared and in a readineſs; ſo that if you come not, and that quickly, Supper will be ſpoiled, and all his labour and charge will be loſt: And will he take this well at your hands? Verily no, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>None of thoſe that were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper,</hi> ſince they <hi>make ſo light of it.</hi> And yet rather than I will want gueſts for my Table, and my Supper be loſt, I will ſend into the <hi>hedges</hi> and <hi>high-ways,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel others to come in;</hi> but as for thoſe that made ſo light of it, they ſhall not taſte it.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45968:42"/>
thus ſhut out from Chriſt's Supper! Is it not then of dangerous conſequence to exclude Chriſt when he knocks and calls, and theſe ſweet and heart-melting arguments (flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the higheſt degree of love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention) are turned back with an unkinde (though complementing) denial?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Argument to prove that to refuſe to open to Chriſt when he knocks and calls, may be of dangerous conſequence, eſpecially when his coming is in anſwer to our prayers, may be taken from the unreaſonableneſs of all excuſes that may be pretended as the reaſon of our ſluggiſhneſs and ſloth. It is true, when we ſhould do any thing for Chriſt that may coſt us any pains or trouble, the fleſh is very fruitful and abundant in producing ſhifts and excuſes to hide and cover our backwardneſs and unwillingneſs: and indeed, ſo apt are we to favour our ſelves, that the meaneſt and moſt unreaſonable excuſe, (to us) ſeems to carry ſtrength enough of reaſon, to render the calls and commands of Chriſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and our refuſal plauſible. If we look back into the Text, we ſhall finde the Spouſe her arguing ſo unreaſonable, that the very arguments ſhe makes uſe of, are ſo far from reaſonable excuſes, that if right concluſions were drawn from them, they would rather
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45968:42"/>
enforce Chriſt's requeſt, than excuſe her ſloth: And at the beſt, they are but frivolous ſhifts to excuſe her ſluggiſhneſs. And (indeed) ſuch are all the excuſes which the fleſh makes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the calls and commands of Chriſt. Let us a little examine them, and you will ſee the weakneſs of them. <hi>I have put off my coats, how ſhall I put them on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Putting off the Coats, intimates to us, the laying aſide of her watchfulneſs, as being free from the fear of any danger, and no longer expecting or waiting for the company of any friend: whereas the keeping of our Garments faſt girded to us, implies the contrary. And this is the argument that ſhe pleads, why it was an impoſſible thing for her to ariſe and open to Chriſt. But is this good arguing, when truely enquired into, and laid down in plain terms? I have laid aſide my watch, I expect no further company of Chriſt this night, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I much deſire it, but had rather take my reſt.</p>
               <p>Is this ſhe that but now, in a ſenſe of her want, had begged ſo earneſtly for Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and was ſo deſirous to be prepared for it, that Chriſt might not finde her undreſſed? Compare this Anſwer with her Prayer, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. and ſee how thoſe two arguings will
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45968:43"/>
ſtand together; and yet both come forth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the ſame mouth. Was her deſire of Chriſt then ſo great? and is her love to Chriſt now ſo cold? Would ſhe then have Chriſt to come (and calls him <hi>her beloved,</hi> the <hi>beloved of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

May not the Spouſe be aſhamed to own ſuch an argument as this? was it not her ſin to lay aſide her watch, when ſhe had begged Chriſt's company? and will ſhe excuſe one ſin with another? excuſe her preſent ſloath with her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfulneſs? Might ſhe not have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably argued thus? I may put on my Coat with ſhame enough, ſince my beloved Husband hath found me in this careleſs poſture, and wretched regardleſneſs of his coming, when I have ſo earneſtly prayed for it. And thus the Argument would conclude againſt her, and be no excuſe for her. But again, I have laid by my watch, how ſhall I take it up again? what, is the Devil, and all the Enemies of thy ſoul aſleep? Is not the night the time when Thieves walk about, and ſeek their opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45968:43"/>
to break through and ſteal? And is this the time to lay aſide all fear and watchfulneſs, and to compoſe thy ſelf for reſt? Is the time of ſpiritual war and danger over? Or rather, art not thou in greateſt danger, when Chriſt hath ſet thee upon thy watch, and himſelf is abſent from thee? Some ſuch thoughts ſurely thou hadſt, when thou ſo earneſtly prayed for his company. Art thou not aſhamed to have the <hi>Captain of thy Salvation</hi> to finde thee off from thy watch, in ſuch a dangerous time? And wilt thou think to excuſe this thy ſin and fault, by telling him that it is impoſſible for thee to put on thy coats, and ſtand to thy watch, now when he is come? Oh unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable arguing! Oh ſhameful excuſe! It is a wonder that thou doſt not bluſh at the ſhamefulneſs and unreaſonableneſs of thine own arguing, and that thine own Conſcience and ſenſe of guilt doth not retort back thine own argument againſt thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>And truely the ſecond part of her excuſe is no better, but in ſome reſpects worſe: <hi>I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> The waſhing of the feet in thoſe hot Countries, was to ſupple them, and clear them from duſt and ſweat, in order to reſt and refreſhment; that they might the better take their eaſe being weary. So that her argument runs thus: I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45968:44"/>
have been exceeding weary with working and labouring all day, and now have laid aſide all my work; and on purpoſe and deſigne, that I might take the more full and quiet reſt, I have waſhed my feet, and am compoſing my ſelf for reſt: and therefore it is unreaſonable to call me out of bed now to defile my feet. Let us a little weigh the argument, and you ſhall ſee, how inſtead of making for her as an excuſe, it makes ſtrongly againſt her. Is Chriſts work ſo weariſome and irkſome, that ſhe is now ſo weary of it, that ſhe muſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely and deſignedly lay it aſide? was it not her ſin to be weary of well-doing? And is ſhe now ſo bold and daring in ſin, as to plead this as an argument to prove Chriſt unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in calling her to her work again? Doth Chriſt ſay, <hi>Bleſſed are they that at his coming he ſhall finde ſo doing?</hi> And may not ſhe be aſhamed to be found idle, and that upon deliberate thoughts? She cannot ſay that this ſluggiſh fit was a ſurprize, and that ſhe was overtaken againſt her will: for ſhe deliberated about it, deſigned it, and in order to her more quiet reſt, had waſhed her feet; and therefore may be aſhamed of it, ſince her work is not finiſhed and perfected. Much more may ſhe be aſhamed to plead this as an argument of Chriſt's unreaſonableneſs in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45968:44"/>
She might indeed be aſhamed to let Chriſt come in and ſee how little work ſhe had done; but little reaſon to complain of her wearineſs with doing Chriſt's work. But this is not all; for her refuſal is moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in that ſhe accounts it a defiling of her feet to ariſe and open to Chriſt. And is this ſo? That which ſhe calls a waſhing of her feet, in reaſon might rather be accounted a defiling them, than her riſing to open to Chriſt; that was her ſin, but this is her duty. That ſhe might be aſhamed of, but this ſhe need not. The dirt of affliction, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in duty, may eaſily be wiped off; but the filth of ſin is not ſo eaſily waſhed off: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the blood of Chriſt can cleanſe from this, and ſhe muſt open and let him in, before this can be done. And therefore, if ſhe had underſtood what ſhe had ſaid, ſhe might have been aſhamed of ſuch an argument as this; but that perſons ſhame at nothing that may carry the leaſt colour of excuſe; when they are mindful to do any thing, they will abuſe, and miſcal, and miſrepreſent things. Wilful ſloath and ſluggiſh ſecurity, laying aſide our watch and the work of Chriſt, muſt be called and nick-named a putting off our coats, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our feet: whereas if this be waſhing the feet, I know not what is defiling them.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45968:45"/>
What horrible blindneſs is there in ſinners, to caſt that upon Chriſt and his work, which he may (with greater force and ſhame to us) caſt back in our faces! And yet this was the Spouſe her excuſe, the unreaſonableneſs whereof we do here ſee. Oh! ſhould Chriſt have given himſelf to eaſe, and compoſed himſelf for reſt, when he was about the work of our Redemption, tugging and toiling at it, till he ſwet <hi>drops of blood and water;</hi> yea till his hearts blood was ſpent, and poured upon the ground as water: and ſhould he then have pleaded this argument that here ſhe pleads to him; <hi>I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> I am well enough, and at reſt in the boſome of my Father, ſolacing my ſelf in the enjoyment of him, and repoſing my ſelf in his eternal Love: how can I leave this, and defile my ſelf with the rags of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and load my back with the burden of humane ſins: and though I be the King of Glory, yet endure the contradiction of ſinners againſt my ſelf, and take upon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

under, to all eternity: and nothing but juſt, becauſe he had wilfully, by his own ſin, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf into this gulf of miſery. If (I ſay) Chriſt ſhould have thus pleaded, when he was about the work of our Redemption, and our neceſſity called for his help, or we were undone for ever; what had become of us? And yet we are not aſhamed to plead ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable excuſes, when he calls upon us to open to him. Surely, ſuch unkind requital of Chriſts kindneſs to us, and ſuch unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable excuſes for our own lazineſs and ſloath, may highly provoke and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige him, and prove of very dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to us. The like may be ſaid of thoſe excuſes made <hi>Luke</hi> 14. and indeed of all excuſes that the fleſh can make againſt our opening to Chriſt at his call; becauſe there can be no reaſon given why we ſhould keep Chriſt out of his own houſe (our hearts) ſince he hath ſo dearly bought and paid for them. But by what hath been ſaid already, in this caſe, you may ſee the unreaſonableneſs of keeping Chriſt out of our hearts, when he calls for admiſſion: which may be ſufficient to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rove that it may be of dangerous conſequence, and therefore I ſhall no further enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this head.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I might draw an argument <hi>à facto,</hi> and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45968:46"/>
argue <hi>ab eſſe ad poſſe;</hi> ſuch a thing was, and therefore it may be. It proved of very ſad conſequence to the Spouſe here to keep out Chriſt. He in a diſcontent withdrew, and departed, and left her in a very ſad condition; both in reſpect of her inward guilt, for giving him ſuch an unkind, ungrateful, and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal anſwer; and alſo in reſpect of the pains which ſhe was glad to take before ſhe found him again: before, it would defile her feet to come over the houſe-floor to open to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and was too hard and unreaſonable a work for her to do; but now ſhe follows him, and calls after him, through the mity ſtreets and high-ways, and never complains of wearyneſs, nor the foulneſs of the way; but would be glad to finde him whatever it coſt her, or whatever ſhe endured. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch conſequence to her, why may it not be ſo to us? nay certainly it will be ſo, if we, as ſhe, refuſe to open to him at his call. But I have exceeded my firſt intentions, in enlarging upon the former particulars; and therefore ſhall ſpeak no more to this. The Doctrine being ſufficiently proved, by what hath been already ſaid.</p>
               <p>And ſo I come at laſt to make Application, and the 1 <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> ſhall be by way of Inſtruction, or Information.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:45968:46"/>
                  <hi>Is it of ſuch dangerous conſequence to be ſluggiſh and ſecure, when Chriſt calls?</hi> Then hence learn,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it will be of bleſſed conſequence to be watchful, and in a readineſs to open when Chriſt knocks and calls. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.46, 47. <hi>Bleſſed is that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, whom his Lord, when he comes, ſhall finde ſo doing — He ſhall make him ruler over all his goods.</hi> And therefore by the ſame argument he adviſeth us to watchfulneſs, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearineſs, or giving over till he come, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35, 36, 37, 38. <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning: and ye your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord when he will return from the wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately. Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom when the Lord cometh ſhall finde watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird himſelf, and make them to ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them. And if he ſhall come in the ſecond watch, or in the third watch, and finde them ſo, bleſſed are thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> Mark, that at whatſoever time he come, if he finde them about their watch, and at their work, they ſhall be bleſſed. But that I may clear this a little further, that they are thus bleſſed, conſider with me theſe few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the ſatisfaction that it will be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45968:47"/>
to a gracious heart, to be at home, and at his work, or on his watch, when Chriſt calls. I an intimate Friend do but call at our door we account it an happineſs that he found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> within. How much more will a gracious ſoul account it an happineſs, that his beloved Jeſus, at his coming, found him within, in readineſs and preparedneſs to give him the beſt entertainment that he had? Eſpecially conſidering theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The duty which we owe to Chriſt, to be always upon our watch, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.13. <hi>Watch, for ye know neither the day nor the how when your Lord will come.</hi> which ſhews that it is the will and command of Chriſt, that we ſhould always watch till Chriſt do come. Oh! ſaith the Soul, this is my duty, never to ſleep or be ſecure, but always to be watching: what an happy chance was it, that I was upon my watch when my Lord and Maſter came and that he found me ſo doing, found me it my duty. Surely he will take this well at my hand, and I ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſidering our preparedneſs to receive him. He that looks for a Friend, will have every thing in readyneſs againſt he come, to make his friend welcome. So will a gracious Soul that expects Chriſt his coming, will have every thing in a readineſs for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45968:47"/>
entertainment, and account it his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he had ſo. It will be wonderful ſatisfaction to the Soul, to have Chriſt come, when ſhe is in a readineſs and preparedneſs for his entertainment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the Souls earneſt looking for Chriſt his coming. When we expect a friend coming, and have taken a great deal of pains to prepare, and make ready, for his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have all things in readineſs; we ſtand at the door and watch, and begin to think him long, and ready to think every one that comes to the door to be our friend: when our friend doth come, we are very glad, and bid him heartily welcome, and tell him we began to think him long, and were afraid leſt any buſineſs ſhould have prevented his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore are very glad to ſee him come, and account our ſelves happy that our expectation is fulfilled. So is it with the Soul that is in this waiting poſture for Chriſt. O my dear Saviour! ſaith ſhe, I thought it long that thou hadſt been abſent from me; I gave thee an earneſt invitation, being earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of thy company, and ſenſible how greatly I ſtood in need of it: I endeavoured to prepare and make ready for thy entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and having done that, I began to think thee long, every hour hath ſeemed ten to me
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45968:48"/>
that thou haſt delayed: and I have waited in hope of thy coming, and yet not without fear, leſt ſomething or other ſhould prevent thy coming. But thy ſtay ſo long hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my deſire, and now I am more abundantly glad that thou art come, by how much thy ſtay made me afraid that thou wouldeſt not come. O welcome, welcome, my long look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-for dear Saviour, thy coming makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for my long waiting: now I think my labour and patience well beſtowed; come in, my dearly beloved! for all things are in readineſs, and prepared for thy entertainment. Thus the Soul accounts her ſelf happy that Chriſt came thus ſeaſonably, and that ſhe was thus fitted and in a ready poſture for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and entertainment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they are bleſſed whom Chriſt findes in this poſture will appear, if we conſider the great ſatisfaction that Chriſt will take at his coming, to finde us in a watchful, expecting, and prepared poſture. This poſture will ſo wonderfully pleaſe Jeſus Chriſt, that inſtead of ſitting down, and being attended and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, <hi>He will make us to ſit down, and will come forth, and gird himſelf and ſerve us.</hi> Luke 12.37. We ſhall be the Gueſt, and he will be the Servitour. The ſatisfaction which this will be to Chriſt, may appear in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:45968:48"/>1. Finding us in this poſture, he takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be welcome. If at our coming to our friends houſe, we finde not onely the door open, the houſe dreſſed, and all in order; but we finde our friend in the door waiting and earneſtly looking for us, thinking our tarrying long, we may reaſonably conclude we ſhall be ſurely welcome, now we are come. So when Chriſt findes the Heart prepared, and the Spouſe in the door watching, or looking in the way wherein ſhe expects to ſee him coming; he may thence conclude, that he is a welcome gueſt to that ſoul. Surely, ſaith Chriſt, I ſhall now be a welcome gueſt to my Spouſe, now ſhe is ſo earneſtly waiting and looking for me. And this pleaſeth Chriſt more than all the varieties that ſhe can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prepare for him. For alas! ſhe is but poor, hath no rich entertainment for him, but onely ſuch as is of his own ſending and preparing, and therefore welcome is likely to be his beſt fare, and all that ſhe can give him; and therefore Chriſt expects no great matters from her, but to have the door open, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made welcome when he comes. And where he findes this, he is ſo well pleaſed, that he will ſuffer no want of any thing needful to be while he ſtays. He will be at the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Feaſt, and of the dreſſing of it too
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45968:49"/>
And therefore we read, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. that he not onely <hi>eats,</hi> but gathers his fruits himſelf. <hi>I have gathered my myrrhe with my ſpice; I have eaten my honey-comb with my honey,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Finding us in this poſture, he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that we are at leiſure from other company and buſineſs to entertain him with our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Chriſt loves not to come when his Spouſe is in the throng, or crowd of worldly company and buſineſs; for then he ſhall have no time of private conference and diſcourſe with her, which is the main of his buſineſs; and therefore in this caſe both he and ſhe would loſe the benefit and ſweetneſs of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Friends account that time loſt that they cannot enjoy one another, though they be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the while. If by throng of company they cannot have their diſcourſe and conference, which they deſigned in their meeting, they account their time loſt: and are ready to ſay, What an unhappy thing was it that we met at ſuch a ſeaſon as this, and that thus we were interrupted in our diſcourſe? The more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that friends are, the more private mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diſcourſe they have, and the leſs they care to be interrupted with company. None more intimate than Chriſt and his Spouſe, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> having matter of private conference with her doth not care to come at ſuch a time when
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45968:49"/>
ſhe hath a crowd of other company about her, but when ſhe is alone. And therefore when he comes, if ſhe be not alone, he will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take her apart by her ſelf, and then his diſcourſe will be moſt heeded, and have moſt effectual influence upon her. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we read, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>I will allure her,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and bring her into the wilderneſs, and there will ſpeak comfortably unto her,</hi> or <hi>ſpeak to her heart,</hi> as the word ſignifies. Now when Chriſt findes the Soul waiting and looking for him, all alone, either in her door, or in the high-way, he may well conclude, I come ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, for yonder is my Spouſe all alone, free from cumber and other buſineſs, waiting for my coming, and therefore I may expect her company. And this abundantly pleaſeth him; for it is her company he chiefly comes for. Chriſt cares not to come when the Soul is crowded with the Fleſh and the World: He deſires her company alone, and is beſt pleaſed when he findes it ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Finding us in a poſture of Watchfulneſs, our clothes on, and our loins girt, he may reaſonably ſuppoſe us not to be in a drowzy and ſluggiſh condition; and that therefore his company will be pleaſant, and not burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to us, and his diſcourſe will be better needed by us. When Sleep and Sluggiſhneſs
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45968:50"/>
overtakes us, the company of our beſt Friends is but burdenſome, and their diſcourſe but little regarded; we had rather have their room than their company, their ſilence than their diſcourſe, becauſe we are deſirous to compoſe our ſelves for reſt and ſleep. So is it with the Spouſe of Chriſt, when ſhe is in a ſleepy and ſecure condition, his company is no whit pleaſant, and his diſcourſe ſinks but ear-deep, (if it do that) and therefore doth little good. Now Chriſt loves not to come and finde his Spouſe in ſuch a poſture as this; but when he findes her watching, or buſie at her ſpiritual work, in a lively condition, Now (ſaith he, my company will be acceptable, now in a lively manner will ſhe unboſome herſelf to me, tell me her whole ſtate and condition: and I ſhall as freely impart my counſels and comforts unto her. This therefore is the condition that I deſire to finde her in; and finding her in this condition, it yields abundant ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Chriſt. This therefore is a bleſſed poſture, wherein the Soul is in a poſture to give Chriſt ſuch abundant ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That they are thus bleſſed, that Chriſt at his coming findes upon their watch will appear if we conſider the honours and benefits which he will confer upon them. He will commend and praiſe them, he will give
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45968:50"/>
them honourable titles, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervants;</hi> he will give them bountiful rewards and a ſumptuous feaſt, and he himſelf will come forth and ſerve them: all which is ſufficiently evident from what hath been ſaid before, and therefore needs no further enlargement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may learn the reaſon of the damnable and deſperate condition of many Sinners; and the mournful, drooping, and ſeeking condition of many Saints. It is not becauſe Chriſt ſeldome comes abroad and knocks at the doors of their hearts; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when he comes, he findes ſuch unready admiſſion and entertainmet. If the queſtion be asked, whence it is that ſo many ſinners periſh everlaſtingly, and that under Goſpel-light? The anſwer muſt be, not becauſe he never calls or knocks at their doors, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not open and let him in. Our Saviour tells us the reaſon, John 3.19. <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light.</hi> So Mat. 23.37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, — how often would I have gathered thee, as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings? but ye would not.</hi> So alſo, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, <hi>&amp;c. Becauſe I called, and ye refuſed — But ye ſet at nought all my
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45968:51"/>
counſels, and would none of my reproofs: I alſo will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh.</hi> How often doth Chriſt knock and call by his Word, by his Rod, by his Meſſengers, by the impulſes of his Spirit, and convictions of Conſcience? and yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are in a deep ſleep of Security, and will not open to him. This is the ground of their condemnation.</p>
               <p>Again, if it be asked why we ſee ſo many Chriſtians walking in darkneſs, and ſeeing no light, enquiring (as here the Spouſe did) <hi>Saw ye him whom my ſoul loveth? If ye ſee him, tell him that I am ſick of love. I have ſought him, but cannot finde him; I have called him, but he gives me no anſwer.</hi> If it be asked, what is the reaſon why it is thus with many Believers? It may be anſwered, there is cauſe for it, they have given Chriſt ſome unkinde anſwer: he <hi>hath called, but they have not heard,</hi> or heeded. He hath knocked, and they have not opened. And therefore he will make them ſenſible of their affront and unhandſome carriage, before they ſhall finde him again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence alſo we may learn what a groſs cheat the Devil and our own Hearts have put upon us, and the great danger we have many of us been in, by our refuſing to open to Chriſt at his knocks and calls. A greater
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45968:51"/>
cheat the Devil could not put upon us; nor greater danger can we poſſibly be in, than to be perſwaded by him to refuſe, or delay, to open to Chriſt. And yet how ordinary is it for the Devil and carnal Reaſon to put this cheat upon us! and by being ſo often and ſo long cheated, what dreadful and tremendous danger have we many of us brought our ſelves into! Chriſt hath called and called again and again, by his Word, and Providences; by his Mercies, and Judgements; by his Spirit, and our own Conſciences: and yet from time to time, to this very day, we have put him off with frivolous and vain excuſes, and have not fully opened the door of our Hearts to him. Chriſt hath preſſed us ſo far with arguments, (and thoſe convincing and ſtartling ones, and of all ſorts) ſo that we could not deny but this hath been the voice of Chriſt, inſomuch that he may ſay, What could I have done or ſaid more than I have done? And yet what cold entertainment hath he found at our doors? May he not juſtly complain of us, as of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord made bare?</hi> It would make a man to tremble to think at the loud knocks and calls that God hath given to ſinners in theſe Nations, and yet to this day hath been ſhut out! few
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45968:52"/>
have ſincerely received him into their Hearts! nay, may it not be truely ſaid as is complained <hi>John</hi> 1.11. <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not!</hi> Many that have made a large profeſſion of the Name of Chriſt, that yet have not truely received him into their hearts. Nay, may not Chriſt ſay, <hi>I am neer in their Mouth, but far from their Reins?</hi> Nay, are there not many that (we hope) are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Spouſe of Chriſt, and have many a time prayed for the breathings of his Spirit, and his comfortable preſence, and yet at his coming have ſhut him out? and yet, where are there any but they have their plauſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes? though if they were all examined, they would prove as unreaſonable as this in the Text. But theſe we ſhall make further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into under another Uſe: onely here let us take notice what an horrible cheat the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and carnal Reaſon have hereby put upon us; and what a ſad and dreadful condition we have hereby brought our ſelves into. Which will undeniably appear, if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What, and who thoſe pretended Friends and Lovers are that we have entertained in our hearts, while we have ſhut out Chriſt, and refuſed to open at his call. Shall I tell you 1, what, and 2, who they are?</p>
               <p n="1">1. What they are. The Lovers which we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45968:52"/>
have doted upon, and entertained in our hearts while Chriſt hath been kept out, they are firſt, Falſe and flattering Lovers. They do not love us really and cordially, though they make great ſhew and pretence of love. There is none that loves ſo really as Jeſus Chriſt doth. His love was towards us while we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him, and did him much diſſervice; but theſe onely love us while we pleaſe and gratifie them. Do but croſs the Devil, the World, or Fleſh, and you ſhall finde they will hate you, and manifeſt themſelves your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Chriſt's love is pure love, without any by-ends: but the love of theſe is onely a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended love for their own ends, and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of their own deſignes. His love is a love indeed; and he hath by what he hath done and ſuffered for us, in real and great deeds, manifeſted the reality of his love: but their love is meerly verbal and complemental, promiſing much, but performing little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what they promiſe. His love is chiefly manifeſted in adverſity, in ſtraights, in diſtreſſes, when all others frown upon us, and we have now hither to betake our ſelves but to him: but their love is onely in proſperity, and when we have the leaſt need of them: For if ever we really ſtand in need of them (as at death and at Judgement) then they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45968:53"/>
will be the furtheſt off from helping us, of affording any relief: nay then they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be our enemies, and the firſt that ſhal ſet themſelves againſt us: And are theſe friends to be truſted, and to be kept in our hearts, when Jeſus Chriſt muſt be ſhut out? How do we ſuffer our ſelves to be miſerably deluded by theſe errand cheats?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Lovers and pretended Friends, they are unprofitable Lovers and Friends. Let them afford the beſt help they can, they can afford no ſuch benefit and advantage as Jeſus Chriſt can and doth. The Wiſe-man ſpeaking of worldly things ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? Riches certainly make themſelves wings, and flie, as an eagle towards Heaven:</hi> There is no ſecuring or holding faſt theſe things. When the Devil would have tempted our Saviour to worſhip him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. he ſhews him all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World, and the glory of them; and faith, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> And yet this was not in his power to give. But ſuppoſe theſe were in his power to give, and that he would be as good as his word, and really give them; yet, <hi>What would it profit a man to gain the whole world, and looſe his own ſoul? Or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> But
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45968:53"/>
ſuppoſe he would perſwade you, that you might gain the one and ſave the other: yet the Apoſtle tells us the contrary, 1 Joh. 2.15. <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And I am ſure, if the love of God be not in him, he cannot ſave his ſoul: For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.8. and <hi>If we love not him that is begotten, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love him that begetteth; for the Father and the Son are one:</hi> and therefore there is no real profit to be got by them, but are great loſers, and therefore in hearkening unto them we are miſerably cheated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are very uncomfortable Friends, if compared with Chriſt. They pretend Mirth, and Pleaſure, and Delight, but even in the midſt of mirth the heart is ſad: no real mirth or chearfulneſs can they give. But he that hath but once taſted how good and pleaſant Chriſt's company is, he may truely ſay, he never met with ſuch a good, and chearful, and comfortable Friend in all his life; he may ſay with the Spouſe, <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was pleaſant to my taſte.</hi> There is none of theſe pretended friends, but there is much ſowreneſs, harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unpleaſantneſs to be found in them: but of Jeſus Chriſt it may be ſaid, <hi>He is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45968:54"/>
lovely; his</hi> very <hi>yoak is eaſie, and his burden light:</hi> there is comfort in his very Croſs; in his company a Believer may ſing at midnight in a priſon, with his feet faſt in the ſtocks: but as for the pleaſures of ſin, they are but ſhort, and they alwaies end in pain. What <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of ſin in reſpect of profit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What profit had ye in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> So may I ſay, What pleaſure can you take in thoſe pretended friends, whoſe company will certainly end both in ſhame and pain?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their deſigne is deſtructive. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may pretend, and however they may flatter thee, and promiſe reſt, and ſleep, and quietneſs, it is but that they may deſtroy thee, and that to all eternity. They are but ſuch-like friends to thee as <hi>Dalilah</hi> was to <hi>Sampſon;</hi> if ſhe cauſe him to ſleep upon her lap, it is but that ſhe may cut his Locks, and deliver him weak into the hand of his enemy to torment him. If they cry <hi>Peace, peace</hi> unto thee, and lull thee aſleep in ſecurity, it is but that they may binde thee (with the Devils) in chains of darkneſs, to be reſerved to the Judgment of the great Day. Are theſe therefore friends to be truſted? Who while they flatter thee, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely deſigne thy deſtruction, and aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the ruine both of thy Soul and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45968:54"/>
Body. Oh how do perſons ſuffer themſelves to be cheated, by the flattering pretences of falſe friends, but real enemies! and in the mean while keep out Jeſus Chriſt out of their hearts, who would be a friend indeed. Thus you ſee what thoſe are that are entertained in the heart, while Jeſus Chriſt is ſhut out. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us ſee who theſe are, that do thus cheat us. I will in ſhort tell thee who they are (though by the marks which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given of them, thou mayeſt eaſily gueſs who they are.) They are the three grand Enemies of thy Soul. The Devil, the World, and the Fleſh: Theſe are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, that thou (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them for thy friends, and welcome gueſts into thy heart) art cheated by. Enemies they are, and the greateſt, and moſt inveterate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, malicious, and unmercyful Enemies that thou haſt. Yea, beſides them thou haſt not ſuch Enemies in all the world; and yet theſe doſt thou receive for thy boſome-friends: and that while thou ſhutteſt out him that is the beſt and ſureſt friend that thou haſt in the world, that hath done more for thee than all the world beſides. What <hi>Joab</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi> when he mourned ſo exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſively for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> that may I truely ſay to thee: <hi>By this I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that thou loveſt thine Enemies, and hateſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45968:55"/>
thy Friends.</hi> For if theſe falſe, diſſembling, and rebellious <hi>Abſaloms</hi> might but live, and be thy companions, thou mattereſt not though Jeſus Chriſt be ſtarved to death at the door of thine heart. Oh wretched cruelty! and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided, blindfolded affection! that will thus be cheated from time to time by the flatteries of them that ſeek thy life! and theſe muſt needs be they that keep poſſeſſion in thy heart; for none but theſe (who have ever been mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies to Jeſus Chriſt) would give thee counſel to keep Chriſt out of thy heart. To be ſure, God would not give thee this advice; for he loves and is ever well pleaſed with his Son, and would have him ſeated in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Throne of thy Heart. Yea, he is <hi>reconciling the world unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He hath appointed thy reception and entertainment of Jeſus Chriſt as the onely way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Surely it is not Chriſt that counſels thee thus; for it is he that <hi>ſtands knocking at the door</hi> of thy Heart for entrance and admiſſion. It is not the Spirit of God, for he is alſo the Spirit of Chriſt, and is ſent upon his errand, to perſwade thee to open to Chriſt: yea, he is heartily <hi>grieved,</hi> when thou <hi>reſiſteſt</hi> theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his. And if Chriſt may not come in, he will not long ſtay there himſelf ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45968:55"/>
with thee. It cannot be thy Conſcience, for that is a faithful witneſs and admoniſher, and will ſpeak truely when it may be heard: and the counſel it gives is according to the will of God, whoſe vice-gerent it is, and whoſe authority it bears in the Soul; and therefore it can be no other that gives thee this counſel, but thoſe Enemies before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Satan, the World, and the Fleſh; for the counſel is like them, and rightly fathers it ſelf: and what folly is it thus to be cheated by ſuch Enemies to thy Soul as theſe are, and that from time to time?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The greatneſs of this cheat, and the wrong which we ſuſtein by it will appear, if we conſider the advantage which theſe our Enemies have got, by our hearkning unto them, and ſuffering our ſelves to be cheated by them thus long. I ſhall onely mention theſe three advantages they have got, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading thee to keep thy heart ſhut againſt Chriſt. Advantages they are to them and their deſignes; but moſt fearful wrongs to thee, and to thy Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have occaſioned thee to commit many a ſin, which might have been prevented if thou hadſt long ſince opened to Chriſt at his call. I do not here ſpeak of thy great ſin in refuſing to open at Chriſt's call, which is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45968:56"/>
every time renewed and repeated, when thou refuſeſt to open, whatever thine excuſe be Nor do I ſpeak of the ſins that are couched and included in the unreaſonableneſs of thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, though theſe be neither few nor little But I ſpeak of that ſinful frame of heart and courſe of life, that thou leadeſt and liveſt it while Jeſus Chriſt is kept out of thy Soul. Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flect upon thy ſelf, and conſider how long it is ſince Chriſt gave thee the firſt call, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what courſe of life thou haſt led ſince how many wilful and known ſins thou hath committed, one upon the back of another yea the ſame ſins many a time over and over again: theſe ſins, all of them, might have been prevented, and many of them (doubtleſs) had been prevented, if thou hadſt opened to Chriſt at his firſt call. If thou hadſt ſuffered him to have come in, he would have changed the habit, frame, bent, and inclination of thy heart, and courſe of thy life and converſation he would have ſet thee about his work, and kept thee employed in his buſineſs, that thou ſhouldeſt not have had time or leaſure to have hearkned to Satans temptations. It is Satan finding us idle, that moſtly gives advantage to his temptations. Chriſt would have put his Spirit within thee, that ſhould have helped thee againſt temptations, and would have <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45968:56"/>
thy heart by faith. His grace ſhould have been ſufficient for thee, and his ſtrength made perfect in thy weakneſs:</hi> He would have <hi>kept that thy foot ſhould not have ſlidden,</hi> who is the <hi>Keeper of Iſrael, that neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps.</hi> He would have armed thee with the whole Armour of God, whereby thou mighteſt have <hi>reſiſted</hi> and repelled, or <hi>quenched all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> He would have <hi>renewed thee with</hi> daily renewed <hi>ſtrength in thy Soul.</hi> Yea, <hi>He would have kept thee by his almighty power, through faith, unto ſalvation.</hi> Thou hadſt not therefore had ſo many ghaſtly ſins, to have reflected and looked back upon with a trembling heart, and griping conſcience, with horrour and conſternation, as now thou haſt. If there were no more but this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, (methinks) it might be ſufficient to ſilence all excuſes, and cavils of carnal reaſon, and make the ſoul affraid of ever refuſing to open when Chriſt calls; and might fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the grand cheat and irreparable wrong which our enemies have put upon us, by perſwading us not to open to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="101-200" type="pages">
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the high affront and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which we have given to Jeſus Chriſt, by keeping him out ſo long. He hath called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, and was deſirous to come in,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45968:57"/>
but we would not: He hath ſtood <hi>knocking till his head was filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night,</hi> and yet could get nothing from us but frivolous and vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes. And what do we think will be the iſſue of all this? Will his patience never be worn out? Will his <hi>wrath never be kindled in his breaſt?</hi> Will the ſtirrings of his Spirit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have end? Will the day of Grace never have a night? Will he never <hi>ſwear in his wrath, that thou ſhalt not enter into his reſt?</hi> Tremble, O fond man! to think at thoſe things. It hath been of dangerous and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequence, thus to deny him admiſſion: He hath thereupon withdrawn himſelf and departed, and ſometimes never returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But if he have been found, it hath been after long, weary, and tedious ſeeking of him. And why may he not do ſo again? Nay cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he will do ſo. And therefore the wrong and cheat which the Devil, the World and the Fleſh have put upon thee, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable wrong, which they can never make thee amends for; let them therefore cheat thee no longer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider that every knock and call that Chriſt gives, and we refuſe, doth lock the door of the heart faſter againſt Chriſt, than it was lockt before: ſo that if ever Chriſt get in, he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45968:57"/>
muſt give fiercer knocks and louder calls than ever he did before; he muſt take ſome other courſe with thee, than ever he hath yet taken. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Exhort one another while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitſneſs of ſin.</hi> Sin deceitfully and inſenſibly hardens the heart, and by degrees cauterizeth or feareth the heart and conſcience, that it grows braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and paſt feeling: and then Chriſt may call and call again, and to little purpoſe; and therefore it is unſpeakable wrong which thine enemies have already done thee; and it would be wrong paſt recovery, if they ſhould go on to cheat thee ſtill.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Is it of ſuch dangerous conſequence to be ſluggiſh, ſecure, and ſloathful, when Chriſt knocks and calls, eſpecially when his coming is in anſwer to our Prayers? Then this may afford matter of enquiry and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to enquire how the caſe ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and our Souls, at this day. We profeſs our ſelves to be the <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt;</hi> and if ſo, it is very probable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> he doth now and then viſit us, and comes to the door of our hearts. We profeſs to be <hi>a candleſtick in Chriſts right hand;</hi> and if ſo, it is likely <hi>he walks</hi> ſometimes <hi>in the midſt of the golden candleſticks.</hi> We profeſs to be the Church
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45968:58"/>
and People of God; and if Chriſt hath not intimacy and familiarity with, and gives fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits to his Church, where can Chriſt be expected to be found? We have the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ordinances of Chriſt, and his Name recorded among us: and he hath ſaid, that <hi>where he records his name, there he will meet his people, and bleſs them.</hi> We are under his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care and providence, about whom he is in a ſpecial manner concerned: And therefore it concerns us to know how we ſtand in his favour. And as this is the ſtate of the Church in general, ſo is it the ſtate of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Member, and is the concern of every one of us to know how matters ſtand between Chriſt and our Souls: Whether we be in his favour, and have his pleaſant company; or whether he have turned his back, <hi>withdrawn</hi> himſelf, and be gone away from us in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, becauſe he hath <hi>knocked</hi> and <hi>called,</hi> and we have not opened unto him. And it concerns us the rather to make this enquiry, becauſe the Providences of God for ſome time have been, and ſtill are conſiderable towards us: and the Providences of God ſeem to be near ſome period. Some great work or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God ſeems to have upon the Wheel in the Chriſtian world; which e're long may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be brought to light. And ſuch times of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45968:58"/>
God's remarkable working, are uſually trying, and ſhaking times. To be ſure, it is a bleſſed thing at ſuch a time to be in Chriſt his favour, and under his wing.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this Uſe there are two things to be enquired into. 1. Whether Chriſt have not, and do not at this day emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently knock and call. 2. What entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Chriſt findes, and what anſwer we have made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us enquire whether Chriſt have not, and do not at this day eminently knock and call. Is not the <hi>voice of our beloved</hi> to be heard at the doors of our Hearts, ſaying, <hi>Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>filed; for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night?</hi> We have told you in the opening of the Doctrine, that though there be no paſſage of God's providence exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards us, but it hath ſomething of a call from Chriſt in it: yet there are ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial times, wherein Jeſus Chriſt doth in a more eſpecial manner knock and call, requiring en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and admiſſion. How we might know thoſe times, I have endeavoured there to ſhew. It is not my buſineſs here to aſſigne new times of Chriſt's eminent calling, but by reflecting upon thoſe, to make enquiry whether the caſe be not ours: And whether, according to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45968:59"/>
thoſe ſignes and marks of an eminent call, Chriſt do not at this day eminently knock and call upon us to open unto him. What I have to ſay upon this head, I ſhall ſum up into theſe nine or ten Queries: And by them we may come to underſtand how the caſe ſtands with us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hath not Chriſt of late days eminently called, and at this day doth eminently call by his Mercies? The more largely God's hand is opened in Mercies and Bounty unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or people, the more loud is his call to them to open to him in a way of duty. God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from us according to the <hi>Talents</hi> which he beſtows upon us. If he beſtow <hi>five,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that we ſhould <hi>gain other five.</hi> In be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of Mercies, God doth not deſiredly caſt them away, but expects that he ſhould be ſerved with his own. The more he loads us with bleſſings and benefits, the more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may he expect that we ſhould abound in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>y. The more of any good thing that God beſtows, the more good he looks that they ſhould do with it. The Pſalmiſt makes uſe of God's bountiful dealing to be an argument to his <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>return unto his reſt,</hi> Pſal. 116.7. Chriſt is the reſt of the Soul, as well as he that gives reſt unto the Soul, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45968:59"/>
laden, and ye ſhall finde reſt unto your ſouls.</hi> that is, ye ſhall finde reſt in me, as well as reſt by me. <hi>For in me ye ſhall have peace,</hi> John 16.33. And if this be an argument to return to our reſt, becauſe God hath dealt bountifully with us, ſurely Chriſt calls loud to us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our reſt. His bountiful dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, of late time, and at this day, is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and remarkable: For he hath <hi>compaſſed us about with his mercies,</hi> and <hi>loaden us with his bleſſings and benefits.</hi> The great Peace, the abundant Plenty that God affords, are very conſiderable, if we conſider the broils that are abroad in the world, and the ſcarcity that hath ſo lately threatned us. How hath God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented our fears! been better to us than our hopes! done great and wonderful things for us beyond expectation! We may not unfitly apply that ſaying of <hi>Moſes</hi> to our ſelves in reſpect of God's providential care over us, and kindneſs to us, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.11, 12. <hi>The land whether ye go to poſſeſs it is — a land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year.</hi> Gods goodneſs in this reſpect hath been wonderful, even to admiration, eſpecially if we conſider the uſe that we have made of all theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; which hath been no better than what

But if beſides theſe common or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mercies which God hath beſtowed upon us in common with others, we conſider the particular mercies which every one of us in particular have received, we ſhall finde that they have not been inconſiderable, but remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable. Have we not at one time or other met with conſiderable preſervations, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſucceſſes in our undertakings, when it hath fared far otherwiſe with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Have not every one our particular mercies to take notice of? as health, when others have been ſick; life, when others have been cut off out of the Land of the Living; Liberty, when others have been under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: Preſervations from dangers which we have been obnoxious unto: Deliverances out of evils into which we have fallen. It were endleſs to enumerate the various ways wherein and whereby God hath been eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and gracious unto us. But if we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45968:61"/>
will but ſeriouſly reflect upon Gods bounties toward us, we may be able to give a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, than any other perſon can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate to us. Yea, we may obſerve more heightening circumſtances in them than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can. For many times the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time and place, and our preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, do wonderfully exalt and magnifie mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. May one ſay, I was ſick, and in danger of death, when others did die; in what a condition had I been, if I had died then! ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unprepared for death and another world: had never ſeriouſly <hi>conſidered my latter end;</hi> had got no aſſurance of Heaven, nor indeed taken much pains about it. If I had gone then, I know not whither I muſt have gone, nor what muſt have become of me. May ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, My houſe and family were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when my neighbours was conſumed in unmerciful flames. If ſuch a thing had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me at that time, (in all probability) I had been ruined in mine outward eſtate, and my ſelf and family expoſed to the mercy of others. May another ſay, I was in ſuch and ſuch a diſtreſs and affliction, and ſo involved therein, that I could ſee no way of eſcaping; but the time of my neceſſity was God's oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and <hi>When I ſaid my foot ſlippeth, then the Lord he held me up:</hi> when I was at a loſs in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45968:62"/>
my ſelf, <hi>Had viewed and looked on the right hand and left, and could ſee no help nor hope, then the Lord put under everlaſting arms, and ſaved me.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like circumſtances make mercies to be eminent, when they are guided by an unſeen hand beyond expectation: the more ſignal and eminent theſe mercies are, and the more of the ſpecial providential hand of God that may be ſeen in them, the more loud are the knocks and calls upon us to duty, and to anſwer Gods end in them. And which of us can ſay but in the courſe of our lives we have met with ſuch as theſe, many and many a time? if ſo, they have been calls from Chriſt; and the more eminent they have been, the more loud hath been the call.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hath not God loudly called by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Judgments upon others round about us, which have loudly called upon us <hi>to hear, and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly, leſt a worſe thing happen unto us.</hi> Have we not ſeen or heard of ſome that have been taken away in a very terrible manner, in the very act of ſinning, and (poſſibly) we as guilty of ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſin, as they? How may this make us to tremble, and be a warning unto us! Hath not the hand of God reached us in our perſons; relations, eſtates, houſes, trades, callings, and the like? And theſe have not only been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45968:62"/>
ordinary Providences, but we might in them ſee ſomething eminently of the finger of God pointing at us? Some aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances or other have made them more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to us, than otherwiſe they would have been. It may be, conſider them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they have only been common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as Letters come to the Town by the hand of the common Poſt, or Carrier: but they have been directed to them with ſome particular meſſage, and have intimated ſo much to thee, by the circumſtances of them; this hath been a ſpecial call to thee from Chriſt. And doubtleſs, we have moſt of us had ſuch calls as theſe, if we have but obſerved and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them; and if we have not, the greater hath been our fault and our ſin. If we do but look through the Nation, as the Mercies have been great that God hath undeſervedly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us; ſo the Judgments that have befallen us, have not only been various, but very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſuch as the hand of God hath been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeen in, howſoever they have been handed to us by wicked inſtruments: I need not to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate them, they are obvious to every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant eye. But what do theſe intimate and call for from us? Surely the <hi>rod</hi> of God hath a <hi>voice;</hi> and he that <hi>doth not willingly grieve</hi> and afflict <hi>the children of men,</hi> doth not theſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45968:63"/>
things to us, but there is conſiderable cauſe for it. When God dealt ſo with his people of old, we may read what cauſe God had for it. And certain I am, that the blindeſt among us cannot but ſee cauſe enough, from the hand of God, for all that is come upon us. Only here is the miſery, that every one ſeeks to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, and to lay the blame at ſome ones door elſe: and ſo takes no notice of Gods particular call to him. I would deſire here to ſet before you, and deſire the ſerious Reader to peruſe Gods threatnings to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and the cauſes there aſſigned, and ſee how far they may concern us: read <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronom.</hi> 28.15. to the end. And as for thoſe that would lay the blame upon others, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves, I ſhall only recommend to them that dreadful caution and intimation of Gods minde, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.18, 19, 20. It is but too common among us to promiſe our ſelves <hi>peace,</hi> and drink away our fears; but this will prove in the end, an unpardonable aggravation of our ſin. If we would but take the pains to ſearch the Scriptures, and take a view of ſuch Judgments as God hath inflicted upon Nations, Families and Perſons, and conſider the ſins that have been the procuring cauſe of them, for which they have been ſent; we ſhould need no Prophet to read us our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45968:63"/>
nor any Expoſitor to ſhew us the ſins that God points at in the evils which we labour under; nor ſhould we, any of us, finde cauſe to excuſe our ſelves. Sure I am, the voice of God in his Judgments is eminent; and by the circuits of them, in that they meet with one ſort of men after another, and ſpare few or none, they plainly ſhew the cauſe to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And by the complication of them, and their ſurrounding of us, and hemming us in on every hand, they manifeſt the greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and more unavoidable danger hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over our heads: and therefore the voice and call is very loud, and muſt either be quickly hearkned to, or elſe Chriſt may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, the <hi>decree</hi> may <hi>bring forth,</hi> and <hi>there will be no remedy.</hi> I would ſeriouſly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your peruſal, that one dreadful Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 24, and deſire that your thoughts and meditations may dwell a little upon every verſe, as you go along, and you will not need me to direct you how to apply it; our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conditions, and the paſſages of Gods Providence will ſufficiently exemplifie it. And therefore aſſuredly, the call of God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than ordinary at this day: and none of us can ſay, but that God ſpeaks ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than ordinary unto us. And know, that they which think themſelves leaſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45968:64"/>
concerned in this call, may come to finde themſelves moſt concerned at laſt. I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſuch to one Text of Scripture, which calls for their ſerious obſervation, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. When God's <hi>Judgements</hi> come for ſin, our <hi>Refuge of lies,</hi> and <hi>Covenant with Death and Hell,</hi> will but little avail us. But I paſs from this, which is ſufficiently evident to be a loud call from Chriſt, to a</p>
               <p n="3">3. Particular, by way of enquiry. Doth not God eminently call, by the great liberty and plenty of the Goſpel, which undeſervedly to this day we do enjoy? There is a notable ſaying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He hath ſhewed his word to</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes and his judgements to</hi> Iſrael: <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any nation,</hi> &amp;c. And may not I apply this very pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to theſe Nations? for what Nation under Heaven hath enjoyed the Goſpel more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, more plainly, more clearly, and for a longer time, than we have done? The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel hath not been more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught in any Nation under Heaven, than in this our Britiſh Iſland. No Nation hath had more eminently <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>ſhining lights:</hi> and many we enjoy at this day. Never Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was better inſtructed in the minde and will of Chriſt; (if we do not wilfully ſhut our eyes againſt this light) ſo that other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45968:64"/>
are glad of the <hi>crums that fall from our table,</hi> inſomuch that we may truely ſay with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>If our goſpel be hid it is hid to them that are loſt: in whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> And doth Chriſt thus ſtand knocking and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to this day? ſurely his long patience hath made his call the louder, and to be the ſame with that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7, 8. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts:</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering how emphatically, and (to our caſe) pertinently the Apoſtle applies it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Again he limiteth a certain day, ſaying in</hi> David, <hi>To day, after ſo long a time, as it is ſaid, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. The night is far ſpent, and the day is at hand;</hi> it becomes not us then (who have ſlighted Chriſts call ſo long, and at whoſe door he hath waited ſo patiently) to linger any longer, but ſpeedily to ariſe, and open to him, leſt (his patience being worn out) he ſhould depart in a diſcontent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Doth not God at this day quicken his Miniſters by his Spirit? and make his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, in a more than ordinary manner, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with us to open to Chriſt? Do not the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt (laying aſide all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45968:65"/>
and leſſer matters) bend themſelves chiefly, if not onely and wholly, to the main work of calling home ſinners unto Chriſt; and to all to <hi>open,</hi> and open more fully, and truely, and cordially to Chriſt? Is there not a more than ordinary <hi>Spirit</hi> reſting upon <hi>the Prophets,</hi> quickning and exciting them to this work; inſomuch, that they are very urgent and importunate, and will take no denial, no excuſe from ſinners? but <hi>cry</hi> and <hi>cry aloud,</hi> call and call again, We <hi>beſeech you in the name of Chriſt</hi> to open to him, and <hi>be ye reconciled to God?</hi> Doth not God make Miniſters more warm, more zealous, more importunate in their work? So that (notwithſtanding all the diſcouragements they meet with, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes which you give) they will take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, but renew their ſuit? And if one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will not work, they take another? if one argument will not prevail, they make uſe of another? leave no ſtone, no ſubject, untur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unſpoken to, that they can imagine may prevail with you? What beſpeaks all this earneſtneſs and induſtry, but that Chriſt calls now in good earneſt upon you? for we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>do nothing without him.</hi> It is he that directs us to our ſubjects, and puts a word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our mouths. It is he that enlargeth our meditations, bleſſeth our ſtudies, and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45968:65"/>
the word upon our hearts. It is he that toucheth our Lips with a Coal from his Altar, and helps us to deliver our meſſage <hi>in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and demonſtration of the truth, and of power.</hi> And all this is for your ſakes, that the call might be more convincing and effectual upon you. And therefore if you finde a more than ordinary ſpirit upon the Prophets at this day, you may conclude it is a more than ordinary call. And therefore apply that to your ſelves which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. However Chriſt might <hi>wink at former ignorance,</hi> or neglect, <hi>yet now</hi> (by way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency) <hi>he commands every man every where to repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Doth not Chriſt eminently knock and call at the door of thy heart, by ſecret impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Spirit, and convictions of thy own Conſcience? Doth not the word of God ſometimes come within thy boſome, and not onely prove a general word ſpoken to all, but brings ſome ſpecial meſſage to thee, and ſaith to thee as <hi>Nathan</hi> did to <hi>David, Thou art the man;</hi> or as Wiſdom to the ſimple ones, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23. <hi>How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and fools hate knowledge? turn ye at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> &amp;c. May we not ſay that God is not wholly departed out of his Ordinances? but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45968:66"/>
that yet <hi>he walks in the midſt of his Golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks?</hi> that his <hi>Spirit</hi> is yet <hi>ſtriving</hi> with us? and that yet he hath <hi>compaſſion of his heritage?</hi> and is loth to <hi>leave his dwelling place?</hi> Is there not now and then a ſecret word whiſpered in your ear, that this word comes from Heaven, and is ſent a particular meſſage to you? Are not you ready to think within your ſelves ſometimes, How comes the Miniſter to know my caſe ſo particularly, and to ſpeak to thoſe things that none knows, but God and mine own Conſcience? Why, you muſt know, that this is God that ſpeaks to you by us. It is he that ſends us unto you, and puts words in our mouths, and tells us what to ſay to you: He who knows the ſecrets of all Hearts: directs us what to ſpeak; and he by his Spirit opens your ear to hear, and to take notice of what is ſpoken. And he by his Spirit convinceth your Conſciences that you are the perſons to whom it is ſpoken. And therefore when it is thus with you, you may aſſuredly know that this a ſpecial knock and call from Chriſt. May there not be the ſame inward working in your Hearts, while this word is ſounding in your ears, or repreſented to your eyes in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, that was in the Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> while Chriſt talked with them and opened the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. <hi>Did
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45968:66"/>
not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us?</hi> &amp;c. Have you not ſome ſecret motions, gripings, and prickings at the heart, under this or other ordinance? this is the voice of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Open to me,</hi> &amp;c. and the more ſenſible and piercing theſe are, the more loud is Chriſt's call.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Are there no fears upon the hearts of God's people, leſt Chriſt his ſtay at our doors ſhould not be long? Are there no ſignes and ſymptomes of Chriſt's wearineſs and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>to depart,</hi> ſeen and taken notice of? Is there not a general fear upon the Spirits of moſt men, leſt the Goſpel ſhould be ready to be removed? what ground and cauſe men have for thoſe fears from ſecond cauſes, I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but that there is ſuch a fear (however it comes to paſs, or what it is grounded upon) is evident: and I am ſure this cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hand of God. This fear is an evil of affliction, it diſquiets and troubles the ſpirits of men; and therefore muſt needs proceed from the hand of God. For the Prophet tells us, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>That there is no evil in the City but the Lord doth it.</hi> This negative interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being a more vehement affirmation. And if Chriſt ſhould not wholly depart, and take away his Goſpel, yet his particular cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

may not laſt long; as he gives you a day, ſo he will give you but a day; and then he <hi>will ſwear in his wrath that ye ſhall never enter into his reſt.</hi> How much of this day may be ſpent, you may better gueſs than any one can tell you, knowing how long he hath called and waited: how clear and full convictions have been, and how they are now: how hot the Goſpel hath ſhined, and how cool it is now; and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the evening ſtretched out. And if this be gone, what will it advantage you to have the Goſpel continued? It will be but for your hardening, and the ſealing you up to everlaſting deſtruction. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preacher, and yet you ſee what a meſſage God ſent him to <hi>Iſrae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a very uncomfortable meſſage to a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, to be ſent upon this errand; but yet it is the meſſage that God ſends them to many an one with: and if this be our meſſage to you, it will be ſad. However, we muſt go what meſſage our Maſter ſends us; and if it be ſad to us, it will be ten thouſand times more dreadful to you. Only our earneſt deſire is, that you <hi>might know, at leaſt, in this your day, the things that belong to your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting peace, before they be hidden from your eyes.</hi> And theſe general fears are a loud call to delay or linger no longer, but open to Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="7">7. Are not all theſe Calls, by Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in anſwer to your Prayers? Here I ſpeak to you that do pray: For I am not ignorant, that there are a generation of prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſouls in the world, and I wiſh they were not ſo great a number. There are but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Families that call not upon the name of God:</hi> which the Prophet prayes that God would <hi>pour his wrath upon,</hi> Jer. 10.25. and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will the wrath of God be when it comes. But I ſpeak here to thoſe that do pray. Hath it not been your Prayer, that God would <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into his reſting place, he, and the ark of his ſtrength?</hi> Have not you prayed, <hi>Ariſe, O north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde, and come thou ſouth, and breath upon my garden?

Oh that I might enjoy powerful Ordinances! and meet with the power and preſence of Chriſt in them! that <hi>mine eyes might ſee my teachers, and mine ears hear a voice behind me, ſaying,

This is the way, walk in it!</hi> Such-like Prayers as theſe you have been ever and anon putting up; and in anſwer to theſe your Prayers, Chriſt is come, and ſtands knocking and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Open to me, my Siſter, my Love, my Dove,</hi> and <hi>my undefiled.</hi> Thoſe calls of Chriſt, which are according to your real deſires, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your Prayers, muſt needs be eminent and remarkable.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Are not you the profeſſed Spouſe of Chriſt, that have profeſſedly given up your ſelves by a ſolemn Marriage-Covenant unto Chriſt; engaged and ſwore that you will be his, and at his ſervice? What deeper obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation can you lay upon your ſelves, than you have done? In your Baptiſm and renewed covenanting at the Lords Table, and by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Vows and Covenants upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: So that none in the world can be more ſolemnly engaged to open to Chriſt than you are. And in regard you expect his coming every hour, doth it not ſtand you upon, to be always upon your <hi>Watch-tower, waiting when your Lord will come, that you may preſently open to him?</hi> And now when he both knocks and calls, is not this a ſufficient ſummons to you, to open and let him in? Every call of an Husband (eſpecially ſuch an one as Chriſt is) ſhould have ſo much weight in it, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

the obedience of the Wiſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if not to others, yet) to you, this call ſhould be ſufficiently eminent and remarkable; or elſe your Husband may charge you with diſloyalty and breach of covenant.</p>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:45968:69"/>
               <p n="10">10. Is not <hi>his head filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night?</hi>

               <p>If we take theſe words in a good ſenſe, that he comes fully fraught and furniſhed with all fulneſs and plenitude of bleſſings and benefits that our Souls can deſire, or ſtand in need of; I appeal to any of your ſouls that ever did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to, and let in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever you found any want in him, or were ſtreightned in him? whether he brought not more comfort and benefit with him, than ever you were able to contain, though you opened your mouths never ſo wide? Hath he not fully anſwered, and over-anſwered your moſt enlarged expectations? ſo that you might have <hi>eaten and drunken</hi> far more <hi>abundantly,</hi> if you had been able to contain it? Every hair of his head hath a <hi>drop</hi> of ſome kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment hanging at it, which you might be welcome to. And therefore his call is loud e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when he tells you what he hath brought with him.</p>
               <p>But take the argument in a bad ſenſe, for the ſufferings and afflictions of Chriſt; and they are a loud call. Hath not Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough in his humiliation, in making way to receive you into favour with God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to covenant with himſelf; but you muſt put him to new pain and trouble, by making him to

ſtand waiting, and dancing attendance at your door, while you are ſnorting and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf upon your bed of eaſe and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Was not his once offering up himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin, ſufficient, but you muſt <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him afreſh,</hi> and put him to new pain, by your ſlothful and ſluggiſh delays, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable excuſes? Doth not Chriſt ſuffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in his Name and Honour from wicked blaſphemous wretches, who rend and tear his very Name, wilfully reject him, and will not have this man to rule over them; but muſt he alſo be ſlighted and undervalued by you? muſt he ſuffer in his Miniſters by the revilings, evil-ſpeakings, and perſecutions that they endure in and from the world? and is not this ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, but their Hearts alſo muſt be made ſad by your refuſal to open to Chriſt? The weight of this Argument makes this call to be very loud, and eſpecially at this day, under the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that we now are. And therefore I deſire it may be ſeriouſly conſidered.</p>
               <p>By theſe enquiries we may ſee, that the call of Chriſt at this day is very eminent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; and therefore it concerns us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what anſwer we make to this call; Whether we have done, and really do open to this call, or no: which is the</p>
               <p n="2">2. Enquiry which we propoſed to make:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45968:70"/>
and I beſeech you let us be ſerious in it. It is a matter that greatly concerns us, ſince Chriſt his calls are ſo eminent, and his ſtay hath been ſo long at the door of our Hearts. What anſwer have we made to the calls of Chriſt? have we heartily, ſincerely, and readily <hi>opened the doors</hi> of our Hearts, <hi>that the King of glory might enter in?</hi> But alas! if we deal faithfully in the examination of our own Hearts, and in the account which we give in this caſe, it is to be feared, that Chriſt hath had no better (if ſo good) an anſwer from us, than he had here from his Spouſe: As will appear, if our hearts make but true and faithful anſwer to theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Queries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we have truely opened to Chriſt, how comes it to paſs that convictions are ſo inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and fruitleſs as they are at this day? We finde in the courſe of our Miniſtry the word of God ſometimes working by way of conviction. Perſons are convinced by the word that they are the perſons ſo and ſo guilty, are a little ſtartled and affrighted; are pricked at the heart, their Conſciences ſmite them, and tell them as <hi>Nathan</hi> did <hi>David, Thou art the man,</hi> to whom this reproof comes, that art thus and thus guilty of ſin, art in a ſtate of nature and unregeneracy, <hi>in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bonds of iniquity;</hi> and that if thou
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45968:70"/>
dieſt in this eſtate, thou art undone for ever: That there is no way, or courſe left to avoid this, but by opening to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting</hi> of, and <hi>forſaking</hi> thy ſin, <hi>turning to God with all the heart,</hi> and taking up a new courſe of life. Fleeing unto Chriſt alone for juſtification, in a ſenſe of thine own utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthyneſs. Entering into covenant with him, taking him for thy Prophet, Prieſt, and King; giving up thy ſelf unto him, in all humble, hearty, and ſincere ſubmiſſion to his will, and obedience to all his commands. This the word dictates, and Conſcience ſets in with it, and ſeconds it: And to make up the conviction more full, the Spirit of God comes in, and tells thee, that this condition thou art in, is not to be reſted in, thou muſt either <hi>turn,</hi> or <hi>die: To day if thou wilt hear the voice of God, then harden not thy heart;</hi> ere long it will be too late, thy Sun will be ſet, thy day of grace over, and theſe things will <hi>be hid from thine eyes.</hi> Hereupon thy Conſcience is ſtartled, and thou beginneſt to think with thy ſelf what thou muſt do; and (it may be) haſt ſome ſudden earneſt motions, purpoſes, and reſolutions to turn, and to break off from thine old ways and courſes, to become a new creature. But alas! how ſuddenly are all theſe vaniſhed and gone again, and thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45968:71"/>
faſt aſleep again in ſecurity? Convictions wear off, Affections cool, Fears abate, Sin looks not ſo terrible, thine own eſtate and condition not to dreadful and hopeleſs, Death not ſo near the flames of Hell not ſo hot and ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſo the wook is laid aſide and left undone, and thou <hi>returneſt with the dog to the vomit, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mire.</hi> Or, (at moſt, if theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill) thou goeſt with an inward griping wounded Conſcience, and doſt not really come out of thy ſelf, unto Chriſt, for healing, Chriſt is little ſtore ſet by, or ſought after, but thou patcheſt up a Plaiſter for thy wounded Conſcience of ſome pitiful, poor, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs of thine own, takeſt up ſome ſmall formal Profeſſion of Religion: and thus ſtoppeſt the clamours of thy Conſcience, and Chriſt is ſhut out, and ſtands without ſtill.</p>

(for they are the ſame both in heart and life that they were before) but becauſe their hearts are more hardened, and their conſciences more brawny, and their ſouls more ſluggiſh and ſenſleſs than they were before. Is this thy opening to Chriſt? Is this the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt finds, when <hi>his head is filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night?</hi> Oh conſider this before it be too late, before Chriſt be withdrawn and gone! We have a ſad complaint which God makes againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſ. 6.4, <hi>&amp;c. O Ephraim! what ſhall I do unto thee? — For your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is as a morning-cloud, and as an early dew it paſſeth away.</hi> A morning-Cloud ſeems to promiſe rain, but as the Sun ariſeth it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth away; an early Dew ſeems to moiſten and refreſh the earth, but when the Sun comes to be hot, the dew is quickly gone, and the graſs ſcorcheth ſo much the more: ſo was their goodneſs very vaniſhing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant. They ſeemed to take notice of Gods words, to be affected with them, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and purpoſe amendment; but alas, their promiſes and purpoſes quickly vaniſhed and came to nothing, according to what you finde <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34, 35, 36, 37. Hath it not been too much your caſe? Under convictions you have ſeemed to promiſe God fair things, and there
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45968:72"/>
hath been ſome hopes of your converſion and change: But no ſooner hath the heat of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction been over, but all theſe things have quickly vaniſhed away, and come to nothing. Is this the entertainment that Chriſt hath found? Blame him not then, if he depart, and make you ſeek him before you finde him.</p>
               <p>But further; ſince it is the Spouſe of Chriſt that is here ſpoken of, let me carry on this Query about Conviction a little further: You who really are Believers, and have entred into covenant with Chriſt, and ſtand in a Covenant-relation to Chriſt: Have you <hi>opened</hi> to the calls of Chriſt? Hath there not been many ſtrong convictions upon your ſpirits in many particular caſes, wherein you have been faulty, and your <hi>Conſciences</hi> have <hi>ſmitten</hi> you? and yet for all this, you have ſtifled theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, and have not opened to Chriſt: you have many times been convinced of your Pride, Worldly-mindedneſs, Vanity and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavorineſs, Sloath, and Luke-warmneſs, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to Duty, Deadneſs in Duty, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and diſtruſt of God, and of his Care and Providence, and ſuch like things; and yet your hearts have not been willing fully <hi>to open</hi> to Chriſt in theſe things, and to let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction have its perfect work in order to your reformation: you have heard the Word, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45968:72"/>
known your ſelves to be guilty of ſuch things as the Word hath reproved; Conſcience hath ſpoken, and the Spirit of God hath ſpoken, and yet you have not hearkned to the counſel and dictates thereof, but have turned a deaf ear, and gone on in your ſin ſtill. Is this your opening to him who is <hi>the wonderful Counſellor,</hi> who is <hi>your Lord and Husband,</hi> and whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſhould have influence upon you? Oh my friends! we may all ſadly complain, that in this reſpect we have all of us made excuſes, and kept Chriſt out of our hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the door be not ſhut againſt Chriſt, how comes it to paſs that the Ordinances of Chriſt are ſo little prized, ſo little ſtore ſet by at this day? We told you in the opening of the Doctrine, that one way of Chriſt his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was by his Ordinances. In and by them he convinceth of and reproveth ſin; directs in, and encourageth unto duty; communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates grace, affords his company, gives in nouriſhment, refreſhment, ſtrength, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto the hungry panting Soul. Theſe are the <hi>Wells of Salvation,</hi> and <hi>Waters of the Sanctuary,</hi> that are for <hi>the refreſhing the City of our God.</hi> Where theſe therefore are ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Chriſt muſt neceſſarily be ſhut out, and not <hi>opened</hi> to. We have the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7, 8. enquiring <hi>where ſhe may meet her beloved.</hi> And
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45968:73"/>
he tells her, ſhe may finde him in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in the aſſembly of his Saints: there he <hi>records his Name,</hi> and there he <hi>meets his people and bleſſeth them.</hi> And therefore they that careleſly turn their backs upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, turn their backs upon, and ſhut the door of their Hearts againſt him. Perſons may, and often do, frequent the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, and yet keep the door of their Hearts faſt ſhut againſt Chriſt: But they are utterly out of the way of opening to Chriſt, yea, out of the ordinary way of Chriſts call, that turn their backs upon his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Greater contempt cannot perſons pour upon Chriſt, than to deſpiſe and ſet light by the Ordinances of Chriſt, which he hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as means for the enjoyment of him. And if this be ſo, how ordinarily is Chriſt ſhut out! We complain of the deadneſs of Trade, and what a low rate all kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities carry: but I am ſure Chriſt's trade is very low; the commodities which Chriſt offers in the market of his Ordinances (though very rich and coſtly in themſelves, yet) are at a very low rate in the eſteem of moſt men. O how ſlight an occaſion will keep perſons back from the Ordinances of Chriſt! If any worldly buſineſs be to be done, perſons think it unreaſonable to be moved to leave that, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45968:73"/>
to attend the Ordinances of Chriſt; as the Spouſe here thought it unreaſonable to move her to leave her warm bed, to come to open to Chriſt. O how many will riſe more early, travel further, and take more pains for an earthly bargain, than to meet with Chriſt in his Ordinances! theſe muſt onely be attended at leiſure-times, when men have nothing elſe to do. If the Ordinances of Chriſt loſe men an hour in their ſhops, or a ſingle bargain (if but to the value of a ſhilling) in their trades, they think Chriſt bids them loſs, if he move them to leave their worldly buſineſs and attend upon him. Many value Chriſt and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at a lower rate than <hi>thirty pieces.</hi> Some (again) can ſpare time to attend Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but if it muſt coſt them any thing, theſe Ordinances muſt be forborn. In many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and with many perſons, he is the beſt Miniſter that will be hired at the cheapeſt rate, though his preaching be little to the purpoſe; though he ſeldom diſturb them with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable calls from Chriſt. Others, though they do frequent Ordinances, yet, not as the Ordinances of Chriſt, which binde Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but as indifferent things, that may be done, or left undone, without any guilt or blame: And therefore they make little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ruſhing out of the world and worldly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45968:74"/>
buſineſs into an Ordinance, altogether unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and uncompoſed, but their thoughts and hearts are full of the world as may be: and as little matter of running into the world again ſo ſoon as ever the Ordinance is ended, without allowing themſelves the leaſt time to meditate, or beg God's bleſſing upon what they have been partakers of. Is this your opening to Chriſt at his call? I am very confident this is not the leaſt reaſon of perſons unfruitfulneſs under Ordinances at this day, becauſe the Ordinances are not conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly attended. Nor do perſons allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves time in meditation and prayer that the Ordinance might have its ſoaking influence upon them. By this means, Sirs, you do too ordinarily, if not conſtantly, ſhut out Chriſt. This low eſteem that the Ordinances of Chriſt have among us, doth ſufficiently manifeſt that our hearts are not rightly open to Chriſt. It was far otherwiſe with the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. She <hi>ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was pleaſant to her taſte.</hi> But theſe have ſcarce time, and leſs mindes to ſit down at all, but are in a running poſture, as if Chriſt's bounties were not worth the ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the heart be open to Chriſt, whence is it, that perſons are ſo cold, formal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45968:74"/>
both in their profeſſion, practices and performances? Surely if Chriſt were let in, the heart would be more warm and lively, Grace would be more active in us than it is at this day. We read, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5.5. that when Chriſt <hi>put</hi> but <hi>in his finger by the hole of the door,</hi> though the door was not fully opened to him, yet he left ſuch a warming, perfuming vertue behind him, as ſet the Spouſe her Graces afloat; ſhe can reſt no longer in her bed, but <hi>ariſeth,</hi> her bowels yern towards him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe get the door open, her <hi>fingers drop with myrrhe;</hi> there will be a ſenſible altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humours (to ſpeak ſo) a change of the frame and diſpoſition of Grace in the heart where Chriſt comes, and meets with ready entertainment. The Souls ſleepy fit will be over when Chriſt comes in, and her Graces will fall to their work; Faith will be ſtrongly active, Love will be inflamed, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs will be increaſed, Obedience will be more exact, and univerſal Repentance more deep and ſerious, the heart wholly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly engaged for Chriſt, when the door of the heart is truely opened to Chriſt. But oh, how far otherwiſe is it with us! ſomething of the carcaſs of Religion, and the form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, an external profeſſion of the Name of Chriſt is left; but little of the life, and zeal,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45968:75"/>
and warmth and power of Religion left! In former days, when Chriſt was eminently ſeen in his Ordinances, and Believers hearts were more freely and fully open to him, we ſee what holy, heavenly, zealous, univerſally circumſpect Chriſtians were then to be found; what wonderful works did manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in them, and were done by them. But where have we almoſt any Chriſtians of the old ſtamp and ſtrain left! Now adays we have much talking of Religion; but little holy, ſtrict, and exemplary walking in the ways of God, in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs. Sure I am, there is a vaſt difference between Chriſtians in former days, and thoſe that now live. Then they were <hi>humble, holy, blameleſs in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of converſation, zealous for Gods glory,</hi> live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpiritual and heavenly in their Duties, <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord;</hi> fervent in love towards God and the Brethren, and that not in word only, but in deed and in truth: ſuch as might eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the world. But now, how many profeſſors of Religion are there, who are <hi>Proud, covetous, ſenſual, compliers with the faſhions and cuſtomes of the world, envious, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, backbiters, ſlanderers, having only a form of godlineſs,</hi> very curious about circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, very careleſs about the ſubſtance and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45968:75"/>
practical part of Religion? This ſhews, that though we carry the name of Chriſt in our foreheads, yet Jeſus Chriſt is too much kept out of our hearts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the heart be open to Chriſt, how comes it to paſs that the world hath ſo great a ſhare and intereſt there? Surely where Chriſt comes, he gains the heart, and the whole bent of the Soul is after him: Nothing more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired, or diligently ſought for than Chriſt. <hi>Rachels</hi> language to <hi>Jacob,</hi> upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounds, and with far better reaſon, is the language of a gracious heart to God: <hi>Give me Children or I die.</hi> So ſaith the Soul, Give me Chriſt, or I die: I can no longer be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him: I languiſh and pine away for want of him. If I may have but one wiſh or requeſt in all the world, it ſhall be this: That God would beſtow Chriſt upon me, that I may not onely have an intereſt in him, and title or claim to him; but that I may have his company, and communion with him; may live in the light of his count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>beholding</hi> his moſt lovely <hi>face, hearing his moſt pleaſant voice,</hi> and taſting of his moſt Royal dainties. The breathings of a gracious heart towards Chriſt are the ſame (for reality, though not for degree) that Chriſt his brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things are towards her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>O my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45968:76"/>
dove! — Let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice: for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi> It was thus with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 27.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If he might but have one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, it ſhould be, that he <hi>might dwell in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> and that for this end, that he might <hi>behold the beauty of the Lord, and enquire in his Temple:</hi> and whatever became of other things, <hi>this</hi> (as the main) would he <hi>ſeek after.</hi> But alas! is it not far otherwiſe with us in theſe days? and that among thoſe that profeſs love to Chriſt! if we look what moſt men are buſie about, what takes up moſt of their thoughts, what their diſcourſe is moſt about in all companies, what they ſpend moſt time in, and weary themſelves in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of from day to day: ſhall we not finde it rather to be the World, than Chriſt? I will not ſay, (as is ſaid of the wicked) <hi>That God is not in all their thoughts:</hi> but this may be too truely ſaid of many; that their moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, pleaſant, and abiding thoughts are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the world. Theſe lie down with them; theſe riſe up; theſe go out and come in with them, as if theſe were their onely buſineſs. Doth this argue that theſe Hearts are open to Chriſt? where the door is open, a man may enter in without obſtruction: But here it is an hard matter for a ſerious thought of Chriſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45968:76"/>
to get crowded in: If it come to the door, it gets no further; hath little or no admiſſion into the heart and affections: no abiding there. We read in Scripture of many very groſs ſins that the ſervants of God (for ſome time) have been overcome by: but I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber any (mentioned in Scripture) that were ſincere, that were overcome with the love of the World. <hi>Demas</hi> (indeed) is ſaid to <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this preſent World;</hi> but whether this be to be underſtood of his total apoſtacy from the faith, or onely his deſerting his publick work or ſtation, the Scripture leaves us in the dark, and leaves this brand of infamy and diſgrace upon him. We know what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition; for the love of money is the root of all evil: which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Evidently manifeſting, that there is not room for Chriſt and the World to dwell in the ſame heart. Chriſt himſelf tells us that we <hi>cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> Theſe two contrary Maſters will be encroaching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45968:77"/>
each other, and impoſing their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory commands. So that from hence I conclude, that where the world hath a great ſhare in the heart and affections, there Chriſts intereſt is but ſmall, and the door of our hearts not ſufficiently opened to him. I am affraid that at the great day, when all hearts ſhall be tried and made manifeſt, there will be many a man found, who prayed for Chriſt, had a deſire of him, yea and hoped that he had an intereſt in him, and a love for him; and yet through the prevalency of the world, never truely opened his heart to Chriſt. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your hearts therefore how the caſe ſtands with you. If Chriſt be there, and opened to as he ſhould be; how comes his mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the world, to have ſuch an intereſt in you? and to bear ſo much ſway with you? If your hearts were opened to Chriſt, the world would be more deſpiſed, and Chriſts company would be more delightful, and more ſtore ſet by.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly. If the door of our hearts be open to Chriſt by faith, How comes it to paſs that there are ſo few fruits of Faith to be ſeen? There is no queſtion to be made, but where Chriſt the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> ſhines into the Soul, the door of the heart being opened by Faith, but that it will be Summer-tide with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45968:77"/>
that Soul; Grace will <hi>bud, bloſſom, and bear fruit.</hi> And if all other Graces be fruitful, why not Faith? If Faith therefore be fruitful where the Heart is opened to Chriſt, it concerns us to examine what fruits of Faith we finde in our ſelves. For as Faith hath a large root or foundation (having the whole Word of God for its object, upon which it acts, and from which at all times it fetcheth direction) ſo it hath a large office and work in the ſoul; its work being to <hi>purifie both heart</hi> and life. Acts 15.9. <hi>Purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tells us, that <hi>Faith without works is dead being alone.</hi> I may well compare Faith to a large and frugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous tree, whoſe root or foundation is the whole Word of God, recorded in the whole body of Scripture. The ground or ſeat of Faith is the heart, (the commanding power of the ſoul) the body or trunk of this tree, is the habit or principle of Faith infuſed into us, and nouriſhed in us by the Spirit of God. The ſeveral branches of this tree ſpreading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves every way, are the ſeveral emanations or flowings forth of Faith, guided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the ſeveral parts of Gods word. The fruits of Faith are the ſeveral particular actings of the whole man, guided by Faith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the direction of Gods Word. Now
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45968:78"/>
where the ground of the heart is made warm by the preſence and influential beams of the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs</hi> (being opened unto Chriſt at his coming) the tree of Faith muſt needs flouriſh, and drawing in freſh ſupply of ſap from the rock of truth, which being digeſted in our hearts by Faith, muſt needs bring forth ſuitable and proportionable fruit of all kinds in our lives and converſations. If therefore thy heart be open to Chriſt by Faith, Where then are the fruits, effects, actings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of Faith in all the parts and paſſages of thy life and converſation? Where is thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon, and embracing of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, relying upon his All-ſufficiency? Where is thy univerſal obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, diſcharging duty in every part and condition of life, living by and acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of Gods Word, in every thing thou goeſt about, leaving the iſſue, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and event of all thy buſineſs and concerns to God, to his care and faithfulneſs? Where is thy conſtant watch againſt the deceitfulneſs of thy Heart, the temptations of Satan, the allurements and enticements of the World? and thy faithful reſiſtance of all Temptations? thy deep repentance for, and faithful mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all ſin, ſo far as diſcovered by the Word? Where is thy ſincere, cordial, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45968:78"/>
univerſal obedience to the Word of God, making that thy Rule in all thine Actions; ſquaring thy whole life and converſation, both in reſpect of God, thy ſelf, and thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, according thereunto; giving every Duty, in thy general and particular calling, its due time, place, and reſpect? Not allowing the world to ingroſs to it ſelf what properly and peculiarly belongs to God, his Worſhip and Service; and putting off God with ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſervice as might better fit, and were more proper for our worldly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? My meaning is, our inverting, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in the courſe of our lives) directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that command or advice of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and the righteouſneſs thereof, and all other things ſhall be added.</hi> In all that we do in our general and particular places and callings, keeping God and his intereſt above, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it before the world.</p>
               <p>If theſe be not the fruits of Faith, wherein thy Soul in ſome meaſure abounds, never tell me that thy heart is rightly and truly open to Chriſt: but according to the meaſure of thy unfruitfulneſs, remains (in meaſure and part at leaſt) ſhut againſt Chriſt, notwithſtanding thy pretences to open to him. How is it with you then, friends? In what poſture do you
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45968:79"/>
finde your hearts? are they open or ſhut? It is evident that Chriſt his calls have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable: but what entertainment he hath found in your hearts, that is the queſtion that is now put to your Conſciences to make anſwer to. And I beſeech you ſuffer your Conſciences to ſpeak, and to ſpeak out what they know and can tell you in this caſe. Stifle them not, bribe them not, turn not the deaf ear to what they ſpeak: they are God's Deputies within you. And if theſe condemn you, know that God is greater than your Hearts, and knows all things. You may deceive men, you may deceive your ſelves; but God you cannot deceive. Chriſt knows what entertainment he hath found, and he will make you to know it one day alſo: and therefore deal faithfully with your ſelves.</p>
               <p>And if by theſe things which we have laid before you, we may try our ſelves, this may lead many of us (at leaſt) to another work, which may be a</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Here lies before us matter of deep humiliation, that ſo eminent and remarkable calls of Chriſt as we have been partakers of, have been ſo little regarded by us; that Jeſus Chriſt (notwithſtanding his earneſtneſs and importunity) hath found ſuch cold and poor entertainment in our hearts to this very day.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45968:79"/>
But this I will not much enlarge upon, becauſe I would keep within ſome convenient bounds. It is too obvious and apparent to be denied, that notwithſtanding our great profeſſion of love to Chriſt, deſire of him, and frequent imploring his company by prayer; we have in too ſad and ſhameful a manner ſhut him out at his coming, though his calls have been viſible and convincing. How may we then tremble to think how this our behaviour will be reſented by him! There are many that from what they behold in the world, are aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the apprehenſion of the danger of Chriſt his withdrawing for a time, if not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal departure. But from what uſage Chriſt hath found in our hearts, without looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further abroad, we may finde ſufficient cauſe of fear and trembling. I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that by that time all reckonings and accounts be caſt up, (if Chriſt do depart) not the leaſt part of the cauſe of his departure will be found among his own profeſſing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Such as have <hi>called upon his Name,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after him, and profeſſed themſelves earneſtly deſirous of his company: and yet, when (in anſwer to their prayers) he hath come, have not heartily and fully opened unto him. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me not, I do not here mean by theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of whom I am ſpeaking, onely Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45968:80"/>
and ſuch as make onely an external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Religion; (though there be too many of theſe in the World) but alſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere believers, who have the root of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the truth of grace within them, and ſhall (notwithſtanding all their blemiſhes) be found at Chriſt's right-hand, at the day of Judgement; that yet have too ſadly ſhut out Chriſt when he hath come and called in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their prayers. Think not this impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; for in my Text it is the <hi>Spouſe,</hi> the Bride of Chriſt, that thus unkindly treated him when he ſtood at her door. And it is to be feared he hath found no better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from us. What cauſe then have we to fear and tremble leſt Chriſt ſhould deal with us here as he did with the Spouſe! and therefore with all humility and brokenneſs of heart, to confeſs and bewail, and (for time to come) reſolve againſt this unworthy, ungrateful, and undutiful behaviour towards our Lord and Husband. But I paſs from this to a <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

Is Chriſt no gain and advantage to your Souls? will he bring no profit and advantage with him? is not <hi>his head filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night?</hi> Hath not he the command and diſpoſe of all things? and hath not he promiſed to <hi>give grace and glory, and to withhold no good thing?</hi> Pſal. 84.11. and doth not he aſſure us that <hi>he that ſpared not his Son, but delivered him up for us all, will alſo with him give us all things,</hi> that may be good for us? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.

Oh! therefore let not him ſtand without, while worſe company is entertained in your hearts. What is the reaſon why Chriſtians hearts are ſo full of guilt, doubts, fears, and diſſatisfactions of every kinde? but for want of the company and preſence of Chriſt.

               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe that you could live well enough without Chriſt, while you live in this world:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45968:82"/>
Let me ask you what you will do, or how you will make up your accounts at Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without him? You know that <hi>It is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all men once to die, and after death the judgment.</hi> You know alſo, that <hi>we muſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt:</hi> for <hi>God hath appointed a day, wherein he will judge the world by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 17.31. and that in that day, <hi>We muſt give him account of all that we have done in the fleſh, whether good or evil,</hi> whether ſecret or open, whether in thought, word, or deed: there then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid the meeting with Chriſt; how then do you think that Chriſt the Judge will look upon you, at that day, who have ſo ſlightly looked upon him, when he ſtood knocking at the door of your hearts? Read with ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, to the end, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.11, 12. Oh! the countenance and looks of Chriſt, which to you now is deſpicable, (but to the Saints lovely) will to you then be moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and terrible. Then <hi>will you cry to the mountains and hills to fall on you, and to hide you from the preſence of the Lord, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to abide it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let me further ask you, What is it that hinders you from opening to Chriſt at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Is it any thing that hath the colour or
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45968:82"/>
face of reaſon in it? If not, why do you ſuffer it to hinder you? If it have, let us examine it, and ſee what ſtrength of reaſon may be in it.</p>
               <p>I can but (at preſent) call to minde theſe Three great and main hinderances, that keep men off from opening to Chriſt at his call.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The low and mean eſteem which perſons have of Chriſt's company, feaſts and banquets. The generality of the world are clearly for ſome ſenſible good thing: <hi>Who will ſhew us any good thing?</hi> Pſal. 4.6 Something that may yield them ſome preſent advantage, that may advance their eſtate, their credit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or honour; ſomething that they may ſee with their eyes, or handle, or taſte <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is obvious to ſenſe: but as for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things,</hi> an intereſt in Chriſt, in the Covenant of Grace, a future reward in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, only for the preſent to be received and apprehended in the promiſe, theſe things are little ſtore ſet by. If Chriſt would give them of theſe worldly good things, then they would ſet ſtore by him. But if he tell them of ſpiritual Feaſts, of a Treaſure in Heaven, of a Crown of Glory, and ſuch like things, theſe are not much taking with the generality, of the world. And therefore Chriſt his Feaſts Company and Benefits, being ſpiritual, are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45968:83"/>
little ſtore ſet by, by carnal hearts; and when they are called upon to open to him, they make light of it, as not judging him worth the opening to. But that this is a great miſtake, I might eaſily demonſtrate, for we have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have ſo low an eſteem and value of Chriſt his Benefits and Banquets, if we do but rightly underſtand our ſelves. We will ſuppoſe a man to have all that the world can afford him, both in reſpect of profit, pleaſure, and honour, and yet want true peace of conſcience, true comfort in his Soul; can theſe things give him this, without Chriſt? But where a Soul hath Chriſt, he may have peace in his own Soul and Conſcience, in the abſence of theſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyments. <hi>David</hi> in a wilderneſs, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in a dungeon, with their feet faſt in the ſtocks, their ſtripes and wounds unwaſhed, can ſing praiſes to God with a merry and chearful heart. Nay, my Friends! it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to expreſs that quietneſs and ſerenity of Spirit, that abundant <hi>peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Joy of heart,</hi> contentation and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which a Believer enjoys in the company of and communion with Chriſt: therefore it is called <hi>a Peace which paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> Phil. 4.7. It is called <hi>A Joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. It is not what a man hath, but what gives true Peace, Satisfaction
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45968:83"/>
and contentment to the Soul, that makes a man happy; and this none but Chriſt can do: And therefore his company and banquets muſt needs be not ſo deſpicable as many men account them. But alas! it is their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and want of experience; would they but be perſwaded to open to Chriſt, and make trial of the excellency of his company, and rarity of his banquets, they would have a more venerable eſteem for Chriſt than now they have.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another grand hindrance that keeps us off from opening to Chriſt, is the urgency of other buſineſs. When Chriſt comes and calls, perſons are ſo crowded with other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they cannot be at leiſure to open to him, or give him any entertainment. Men are generally got plunged ſo deep in the cares and cumbers of the World, that they have no leiſure to open to Chriſt: no nor ſo much as to weigh the arguments and motives that Chriſt makes uſe of to procure admiſſion into their hearts. Oh how buſie are men in the world! head and heart, hands and feet; yea whole ſoul and body as buſily exerciſed about the world as may be; and they think all this little enough too, they think they get little enough by it; and how ſhould theſe then have leiſure to open to Chriſt? no wonder though
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45968:84"/>
his calls be ſo ineffectual, when perſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We read in the parable of the Supper, when the Maſter ſends forth his Servants to invite gueſts, one man is buſie with his <hi>Farm,</hi> another with his <hi>Merchandiſe;</hi> but none of thoſe which were bidden had leiſure to come. And the reaſon was, they ſaw a preſent neceſſity and urgency of the preſent buſineſs which they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, but they ſaw none ſo great and preſent need of Chriſt. Many in the world are worſe employed than <hi>Martha</hi> was, and yet think their time ſo well ſpent in that which they are about, that they are loth to be taken off to wait and attend upon Chriſt and his Miniſtry. <hi>Martha</hi> had invited the Lord Jeſus to her houſe, and with him many friends: and that which ſhe was buſie about, was, to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proviſion for his entertainment; a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (one would think) indiſpenſible. And yet our Saviour blames her for this, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.40, 41, 42. <hi>But Martha was cumbered about much ſerving — And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful. And Mary hath choſen that good part, which ſhall
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45968:84"/>
not be taken away from her.</hi> How many are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to conſider whether any thing be more neceſſary to be done, than what they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. To ſuch as theſe I would ſpeak theſe few words. You think your ſelves well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in your earneſt and not purſuit of the world, the cares and buſineſs that onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to this preſent life, and you ſee nothing more needful at preſent to be done. Let me ask you this queſtion: Notwithſtanding the great buſineſs which you have to do in the world, do you not ſometimes finde leiſure to eat, drink, ſleep, dreſs and adorn the body? You will ſay, Yes, without theſe we could not live, nor have any ſtrength to follow our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Well, will time be afforded for taking and feeding upon <hi>the meat that periſheth,</hi> and no time allowed for feeding upon <hi>that meat which endures to everlaſting life?</hi> Read <hi>John</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endures to everlaſting life.</hi> Hath your Body more need of Clothes to cover your nakedneſs, and keep your warm, than your Souls to be clothed with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt as a Robe or Garment? If you did but as really ſee how naked your Souls look in the ſight of God, Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you would be as much aſhamed of your ſelves,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45968:85"/>
as you would now be to have men ſee your Body naked. And therefore conſider with your ſelves, whether there be not as great need to take fit and convenient time for the feeding and clothing your Souls, as there is for feeding and clothing your Bodies. And if there be as great need, I pray you let not your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls famiſh and ſtarve, while you ſo carefully pamper your Bodies, and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your great and urgent buſineſs in the world. Again, you that are ſo earneſt and buſie about the world, and have your time and thoughts ſo taken up about it, let me ask you this one queſtion more: Whether do you judge that your ſucceſs in your worldly affairs doth principally flow from your own wiſdom, care, and pains; or from the bleſſing of God upon your endeavours? I believe that few or none of you will be ſo audaciouſly impious as to affirm the former; (whatever you think) but rather that your ſucceſſive buſineſs doth ariſe from the bleſſing of God upon your endeavours. And if ſo, I pray you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider upon what ground or warrant you can expect the bleſſing of God upon your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, when you wilfully ſhut the door of your Hearts againſt his well beloved Son? and when you make ſo light of him and his company, that every worldly trifle muſt take place of him,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45968:85"/>
and be preferred before him? Might not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you ſucceed better in your worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if you would give Chriſt better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in your Hearts, and cumber your ſelves leſs about the world? Chriſt bids us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof:</hi> and promiſeth that <hi>all other things ſhall be added.</hi> Intimating, that the beſt way to ſecure a competency of this world to our ſelves, is in the firſt and chief place to ſecure an intereſt in Chriſt for our Souls. We ſay, that he that would drive on a Trade, muſt have intereſt and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And I am ſure we cannot have intereſt in, nor acquaintance with a better friend than Chriſt; nor one that can beſtead us more in the carrying on of our worldly buſineſs: For <hi>It is the bleſſing of the Lord that makes rich; and addes no ſorrow therewith,</hi> Prov. 10.22. O ſpare ſome time therefore in the midſt of your worldly buſineſs, to open your hearts to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another hinderance to our opening to Chriſt, may be the difficulty and unpleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the work, either in opening to Chriſt, or when we have opened to him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a difficulty in opening to Chriſt, which a lazy ſluggiſh Soul is hardly brought to grapple with and overcome. Faith and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45968:86"/>
Love are the two principal ways whereby the Soul is to open to Chriſt. And theſe are two Graces, not without much difficulty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto, in the right exerciſe of them Many perſons, at a diſtance, think it an eaſie matter to believe in a crucified Saviour; but when they come to make proof of their Faith in particular caſes, they many times finde themſelves at a loſs. See this in an inſtance, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.24. we have a man bringing his child to Chriſt to be healed; his coming ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued ſomething of Faith; but when the Diſciples had failed in the cure, and the child was rather worſe than better, the mans faith begins to ſtagger, as appears by his words, verſ. 22. <hi>If thou canſt do any thing, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on us, and help us.</hi> Hereupon Chriſt calls him to the real exerciſe of Faith, verſ. 23. <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> The poor man upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his own heart, finding ſome faith, but yet this very weak, and hardly to be raiſed to a firm and ſtedfaſt belief, without wavering or doubting, cries out, <hi>I believe, Lord help thou mine unbelief:</hi> Which manifeſted his ſenſe of the difficulty of opening to Chriſt by Faith, as he ought. And truely, Chriſtians that know any thing of their own hearts (as they ought) finde this a very difficult work in caſes
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45968:86"/>
of an eaſier nature than this, here, of this man was. And therefore a lazy ſluggiſh Soul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be at ſuch pains. There are ſome weary ſteps that a believer muſt take to open to Chriſt by Faith. As (1.) earneſt Prayer to him, who is the <hi>Finiſher</hi> and <hi>Perfecter,</hi> as well as the <hi>Authour</hi> and <hi>Beginner</hi> of this Grace. Faith in the act and exerciſe, as well as in the habit, muſt be obtained of Chriſt by earneſt Prayer. And to tug in this duty of Prayer, as we ought, is no eaſie work, eſpecially if Chriſt for ſome time ſeem to hold back and deny, as he did to the woman of <hi>Canaan.</hi> This puts the Soul ſometimes into a ſweat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eaſeful Soul is loath to be at this pains; his patience is worn out, and he faints and flags in the duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another weary ſtep the Soul muſt take to get Faith into the exerciſe, is the ſearching the Word and Promiſes, and rightly applying them. It is ſometimes difficult to finde ſuch promiſes as may rightly ſuit our condition: When we have found them, it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more difficult rightly to underſtand them according to the true intent and purport of them: ſometimes it may be difficult to get our hearts rightly affected with them; and moſt of all, to clear up our intereſt in them. So that ſometimes a Believer findes a promiſe,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45968:87"/>
and meditating ſees it to ſuit his condition well enough; but yet lays it aſide, can ſuck no ſweetneſs from it, becauſe he cannot clear up his intereſt in it: and that by reaſon of ſome particular condition or qualification annexed thereto, which he findes not in himſelf. In this caſe to believe ſeems difficult, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promiſe is laid aſide, and no comfort gathered from it; upon this account a lazy Soul ſits down in unbelief, and doth not open to Chriſt by faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another weary ſtep is, the overcoming that unbelieving frame of heart which we are naturally prone unto. Unbelief is a ſin which naturally flows from the corruption of our natures, and accompanies us in ſome meaſure, more or leſs, while we are in this Vale of Tears. And this part of corrupt nature poor Souls finde as much difficulty in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, as any corruption. And the reaſon is, becauſe (of all corruptions) none hath more to ſay for it ſelf than this; for the object of Faith (properly) is unſeen things, ſuch as are not obvious to ſenſe, ſuch as ſeem to thwart both ſenſe and reaſon, and frequent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſuch things as we have nothing to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom our faith concerning upon, but the bare Word of God, we are to <hi>believe in hope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to hope.</hi> And this makes the work dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45968:87"/>
hereupon few Chriſtians are ſo reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and induſtrious, as to be at the pains which the Pſalmiſt was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. to ſearch things to the bottom, and to weigh things in the balance of the Sanctuary, and therefore they ſit down without opening to Chriſt by Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another difficulty is the griping guilt of ſin and unworthineſs, which ſo looks them in the face when they ſhould open to Chriſt by Faith, that the eye of their Faith is dim, and they cannot with any confidence look Chriſt in the face. It is an uſual ſaying, that a guilty Conſcience needs no Accuſer. Conſcience will inwardly check the adulterous Spouſe of Chriſt, and make her bluſh when ſhe ſhould open to him and look him in the face. The Pſalmiſt complains, that he was ſo <hi>compaſſed</hi> about, and tormented with his ſin, that <hi>he could not look up,</hi> Pſal. 40.12. It is a miſtake very common in humbled penitent ſinners, that they muſt not, dare not, by Faith open to, and cloſe with Chriſt, till they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſuch a meaſure of internal purity and Sanctity as may make them fit for, and (in a ſort) worthy of his company. But theſe begin their work at the wrong end: They ſhould firſt open to Chriſt by Faith, and then he will help them to, and carry on in them this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45968:88"/>
work of purity: For it is his work by his Spirit to purifie, and this purifying vertue we muſt fetch from him by Faith: for <hi>It is he that worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure,</hi> becauſe <hi>without him we can do nothing.</hi> Our work is firſt to believe, and then by Faith to mortifie the deeds of the fleſh. Now this work is difficult, to open to Chriſt, and look him in the face by Faith, with the guilt of ſin upon our Conſciences. This goes contrary to the grain of Fleſh and Blood, who would gladly have ſomething of its ſelf and its own Righteouſneſs in its juſtification. Whereas our work is to diſclaim all worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own, and to come to Chriſt <hi>with Ropes about our Necks,</hi> as ſelf-condemned perſons, lying at the foot-ſtool of pure Grace, and Chriſts Righteouſneſs for juſtification and life. And therefore where there remains any meaſure of pride in the Heart, according to that meaſure and degree of pride, Chriſt will be ſhut out: The weary ſtep of ſelf-denial (in this caſe) the ſluggiſh Chriſtian is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the work it ſelf in opening to Chriſt by Faith is very difficult, and hence the lazy Chriſtian lies down upon his bed of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eaſe, and refuſeth to be at the pains to open to Chriſt by Faith. But, would the Soul but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45968:88"/>
conſider the amends that Chriſt's company would make for all his pains, and how eaſie all theſe duties would be made by Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in; ſurely the Soul would never think his pains better beſtowed than in opening to Chriſt by Faith. It is he that by his Spirit <hi>helps our infirmities</hi> in prayer, and helps us by his own ſtrength to wreſtle with himſelf and prevail. It is he that brings promiſes to our minde, helps us to underſtand and rightly to apply them, and to take the ſweetneſs and the comforts of them. It is he that gives us a <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſight of unſeen things, and aſſures our Souls of the certainty of them. It is he that helps our unbelief: And it is he, and he alone, that by his Blood muſt purge away the guilt of all our ſins. Oh! therefore open to Chriſt by Faith, and let not theſe impediments hinder you.</p>
               <p>And as in Faith, ſo in opening the Heart to Chriſt by Love, there is great difficulty; much ado to bring the Heart to open fully to Chriſt by Love. Theſe worldly things ſeem ſo lovely, that the Heart is much ſtolen away by them! Theſe worldly things are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly preſent with us, that it is hard to get a ſight of Chriſt, who is at a diſtance, and ſeen (as it were) afar off. Theſe worldly things are ſo obvious and ſuitable to ſenſe, (by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45968:89"/>
which we too much live) that the object of Faith is little notice taken of. To love him therefore, and that with ſuch a love as we ought, <hi>whom we have not ſeen,</hi> this is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult: To open our Hearts and Affections to him that we never ſaw with our eyes, but onely have heard tell of; this is very difficult, and ſcarcely attainable by a ſluggiſh Soul, that is unwilling to be at the pains to enquire after him. But let not this hinder, for we have ſuch diſcoveries of him in the Word, (if we will but be at the pains to ſearch them out) as will render him <hi>altogether lovely;</hi> far more deſirable than the moſt precious thing in the world. And therefore let not ſloth hinder us from opening to Chriſt by love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there may be difficulty and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs in opening, ſo there may be difficult and unpleaſant work when we have opened to Chriſt, and let him in; and the thought of this may make the Soul unwilling to open to Chriſt. As for inſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt at his coming in, may rip up our old ſores, and bring our ſins to remembrance, which may renew our torment and pain. When Chriſt comes in, he makes new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in the Soul: many a ſin forgotten, and not duly repented of, is brought to minde; and the ſting of it wounds and cuts the Soul,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45968:89"/>
puts the Soul to new ſorrow, ſhame, and pain: and this makes the Soul afraid of opening to Chriſt. There is in every one ſuch an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ible ſenſe of the holineſs of Chriſt, and of their own guilt, that (though the Soul may have a real deſire of Chriſts company, yet) is really afraid to let him in, leſt Chriſt ſhould diſcover there what the Soul is afraid to have ſeen. And therefore it argues not onely the ſincerity and truth of Grace, but a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaſure of the prevalency of Grace, when the Soul, without inward reluctancy or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, can ſay as <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 139.23. <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts.</hi> This is a work wherein the Soul would be tenderly dealt with: and leſt Chriſt (in this caſe) ſhould deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and roundly, the Soul is afraid to open to Chriſt. Though Reaſon will pray with us to have our Wounds ſearched, yet Nature it ſelf is afraid to have the Surgeon meddle with it. Such is the caſe here; and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count many faint-hearted Chriſtians are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to open to Chriſt; but rather ſhut him out.</p>
               <p>But, oh my Friends! If this be the reaſon why Chriſt is not readily opened to by you, let me tell you, The longer you keep him out, the worſe it will be with you: your Soul is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45968:90"/>
ulcerated with ſin, it is not found at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; and if Chriſt be not let in at all, you muſt unavoidably periſh of this wretched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe. And if you do let him in hereafter, he muſt then ſearch it to the bottom, and in the mean time your ſin frets as a canker, eats deeper and deeper into your heart; and will not your pain be the more intolerable, when your wound comes to be ſearched? And therefore let ſpiritual reaſon prevail with you to open to Chriſt, without any more delay. That which here thou makeſt uſe of as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why thy heart is ſhut againſt Chriſt, ſhould be a ſtrong, yea the ſtrongeſt argument to the contrary, to open to Chriſt quickly. It is infinite Mercy that thou haſt ſo precious a Surgeon at hand. It would be a moſt childiſh thing then to ſhut him out of doors, becauſe thou needeſt his help, but art afraid leſt he ſhould ſee, and rip up thy ſore. This fleſh-pleaſing eaſefulneſs is that which ruines many thouſands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He may call us off from our earneſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the world and worldly buſineſs, which is urgent upon us: He may ſay to thee, Come, <hi>follow me;</hi> be not ſo haſty in the purſuit of the world, lay aſide thy buſineſs for a while, I have other buſineſs for thee to do; let me have thy company a little, for, for that end
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45968:90"/>
am I come. This may be the language of Chriſt to the ſoul. But this is very unpleaſing unto the Soul, that is hot and earneſt in the purſuit of the world; this ſoul will be ready to anſwer as the man in the Goſpel, <hi>Lord I will follow thee, but ſuffer me firſt to go and bury my father;</hi> let me but diſpatch ſuch or ſuch, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that is urgent upon me, and then I will wait upon thee. But O Soul! conſider with thy ſelf, what haſt thou of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do, than to hearken to and obey the voice of Chriſt? If Chriſts company be no more worth, and his feaſt of no greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, he may reſolve thou ſhalt not taſte of his dainties.

               <p n="3">3. Chriſt at his coming into the Soul, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times puts his Spouſe or People upon ſome unpleaſant work which they would gladly be excuſed from; and this may be an hindrance to their opening to him. Sometimes he calls to, and puts them upon renewed acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (as was hinted before.) Sometimes upon the mortification of ſome beloved luſt, which may be as painful, and as unwillingly yielded to, as the <hi>cutting off the right hand, right foot; or plucking out the right eye.</hi> Nay, his Word may (further) <hi>be quick and powerful, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the joynts and marrow, diſcerning</hi> and diſcovering <hi>the thoughts and intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4.12. which the Soul is not willing ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, or cut off: or at leaſt is afraid of the pain and trouble it may be put to in this work; and therefore lingers, and puts off Chriſt from time to time. Sometimes (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) Chriſt may put his Spouſe upon ſuch duties, as may croſs her natural inclination, or particular, preſent, and viſible intereſt. Such as <hi>denying her ſelf, taking up her croſs, following him. Enduring hardſhip as a good ſouldier for Chriſt. Enduring reproaches, evil-ſpeakings, perſecutions,</hi> and the like: all which are unpleaſing to fleſh and blood: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45968:91"/>
the Soul muſt ſay (as to its natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) as our Saviour ſaid when he prayed, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> Here the Soul often ſticks, and upon theſe terms, is loth to open to Chriſt, the fleſh having ſo ſtrong an influence upon the ſoul. Upon ſuch terms as theſe the young man in the Goſpel went away from Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21, 22. — <hi>Go thy way, ſell whatſoever thou haſt, and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven: and come take up thy croſs and follow me. And he was ſad at that ſaying, and went away grieved,</hi> &amp;c. I am afraid there are but too many in this age that would account theſe too hard terms to accept of Chriſt upon.</p>
               <p>But if men would but argue rationally, why ſhould theſe be any hindrances to our opening to Chriſt? for in all this Chriſt bids us no loſs. If he bids us part with Earthly, he promiſeth us Heavenly treaſure. If he bids us cut off a corrupt part or member, (though it be painful, yet) it is in order to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation of the whole, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29, 30. and is it not better to loſe a corrupt part, than loſe the whole?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt at his coming may excite us to, and quicken us in our work, may call us to be quicker, and more exact and curious in our work. He may tell us that our work is great,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45968:92"/>
and our time but ſhort. He may bid us <hi>ſtrive</hi> with all our might <hi>to enter in at the ſtraight gate; for many ſhall,</hi> (in a lazy and ſloathful manner) <hi>ſeek</hi> and wiſh <hi>to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> He may tell us, that this lazy ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful working will not attain the end that we aim at; for <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the violent</hi> onely <hi>take it by force.</hi> It will not ſerve our turns to read, pray, hear, meditate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the cold and careleſs rate which we do. It will not do well to be ſuch ſtrangers (as we are) to our own hearts; but we muſt examine our own hearts more deeply, throughly, and effectually: muſt ſtudy and practice our duties more throughly: muſt <hi>watch unto prayer,</hi> and <hi>give our ſelves unto prayer: Muſt make the Law of God our delight and daily meditation: muſt in all things,</hi> ſmall as well as great, <hi>exerciſe a Conſcience void of offence towards God and Men:</hi> Muſt ſet a <hi>watch</hi> before the door of our <hi>Hearts, Lips,</hi> and <hi>lives: Muſt</hi> (in ſhort) <hi>forgetting thoſe things that are behinde, and reaching forward to thoſe things that are before, preſs towards the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He may come to ask us ſuch queſtions as theſe: What have you been doing ſince the laſt time I was with you? what have you learned? what have you practiſed? what proficiency
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45968:92"/>
have you made? what account can you give of the Talents which I betruſted you with? in what forwardneſs is your work? let me ſee how matters ſtand with you? what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes have you on foot for my glory? and what are the deſignes which you are now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on? Theſe and ſuch-like queſtions may be asked by Chriſt at his coming in. Now if the Soul have been idle and careleſs, and not able in any meaſure to give a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in theſe and ſuch-like caſes; no wonder though ſhe be unwilling (at this time) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Chriſt. The fear of having her faults diſcovered, and the guilt of them to diſturb the quiet of her Conſcience, will make her very ſlow in opening to Chriſt, (as was noted before.)</p>
               <p>But if reaſon might take place, this ſhould be no hinderance at all; for what Chriſt tells us, is real truth, that our work is great, and <hi>our time but ſhort,</hi> paſſing on a pace, and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable when gone: and if we have ſlept or loitered, is it reaſon that we ſhould do ſo ſtill? Is it not <hi>high time to awake out of ſleep?</hi> the <hi>night is far ſpent, the day is at hand.</hi> If he ſhould let us ſleep or loiter on till his laſt call, to come to the <hi>Wedding,</hi> as he did the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. in what a condition would you be when you ſhould awake, <hi>your
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45968:93"/>
lamps gone out, no oyl in your veſſels,</hi> no neighbour to borrow of, every one having little enough for himſelf, and you muſt be forced to go to buy, when you ſhould, enter in with him, and by this means you come to be ſhut out, and looſe your whole expectation? Were it not better let in Chriſt now, and be content to ſhake off ſleep, while you have time to get <hi>oyl into your veſſels with your lamps?</hi> We uſe to ſay, that delays in moſt caſes are very dangerous; and that it is bad putting off things to the laſt: I am ſure this is moſt true in this caſe, that ſo greatly concerns the eternal ſtate of our Souls. Nay further, if things be amiſs in us, is it not better to let Chriſt come in, and put all things to rights in us, then to let them go at random, till they be paſt cure? I am ſure there never was Soul that ever repented of this, whatever pain it was put to in the doing of it; though many a Soul hath ſadly repented the ſhutting out of Chriſt, when it hath been too late. It is better that Chriſt bring thy faults and ſin to light and remembtance here, while thou mayſt repent and reform; than that thy ſin ſhould finde thee out in the guilt, ſhame, and puniſhment of it to all eternity hereafter: <hi>And be ſure thy ſin will,</hi> at one time or other, <hi>finde thee out,</hi> Numb. 32.23. Oh! therefore let none of theſe things have influence upon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45968:93"/>
you, to hinder you from opening to Chriſt at his call.</p>
               <p>I dare be bold to ſay, that there can be no true ſpiritual reaſon, for any poor ſoul to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to open to Chriſt; <hi>all reaſons</hi> produced for that end are <hi>carnal,</hi> and therefore ought to be pulled down and deſtroyed; <hi>For the weapons of our warfare are not</hi> (ought not to be) <hi>carnal, but mighty; to the pulling down— all imaginations;</hi> or (as the word ſignifies) cavils, or carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings. One of theſe two cauſes (doubtleſs) both which are bad, theſe carnal reaſonings muſt proceed from; either from a ſecret love to ſome ſin, or luſt in the heart, which we would not have Chriſt to diſcover or purge out; which may well call in queſtion the truth and ſincerity of Grace in us: for the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my prayer:</hi> And it is certain, He doth hear the Prayers of ſuch as are ſincere; for he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.18. <hi>The Lord is nigh unto all that call upon him — in truth.</hi> So that thy ſincerity is queſtionable. Or elſe it proceeds hence, <hi>viz.</hi> from Pride and Self-love. Pride, becauſe thou wouldeſt not have Chriſt to ſee things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>miſs in thee: but know, that <hi>God reſiſts the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</hi> From Self-love, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n that thou ſo much deſireſt the eaſe, and gratification of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45968:94"/>
the fleſh: Now if thy very <hi>life</hi> be more <hi>dear</hi> to thee than <hi>Chriſt, thou art not worthy to be his diſciple.</hi> O let none of theſe baſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arguments keep thee off from opening ſpeedily to Chriſt at his call.</p>
               <p>I might tell thee alſo of the advantages that will come by opening to Chriſt, but theſe I have largely ſpoken to before, only this one give me leave to mention here; If thou wilt freely open to Chriſt now, He will readily open to thee at Death and Judgment. There are few but they are convinced of the trouble and reſtleſneſs of their preſent ſtate, and not fully ſatisfied with the preſent ſtate they are in, but are ſtill ſeeking and labouring for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further, in hopes another condition may be better: and this they might gather from all their experiences, that a reſt is not to be had here. And conſequently all men (in this life) are but in a ſeeking condition, ſeeking for reſt and can finde none, (as our Saviour ſpeaks in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) they have often ſomething within that ſuggeſts, <hi>This is not your reſting place:</hi> By dayly experience they alſo ſee, that <hi>it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for all men once to die:</hi> And therefore they might conclude, that a reſt muſt be had in another world, or not had at all; for here no reſt is to be had. And certain it is, that <hi>There doth remain a reſt for the people of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:45968:94"/>
and to them only: and who are theſe people of God, but they that open to Chriſt here? for <hi>all power is committed into the hands of Chriſt. He</hi> it is <hi>that hath the key of David, that openeth and no man ſhutteth, and ſhutteth and no man openeth:</hi> And can we reaſonably imagine that he will open to any (at that day) that will not open to him now? No; he tells us quite the contrary, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, &amp;c. You know the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins cryed loud, <hi>Open to us;</hi> but he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>I know you not, depart from me ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity.</hi> If therefore there be any reſtleſſneſs in this world that thou art weary of, or in Hell that thou art afraid of; or if there be any reſt at death and in Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable, open to Chriſt now, as ever thou wouldeſt avoid the one, or deſireſt to partake of the other. So (that to conclude this Uſe) if either ſenſe of duty, love to thy ſelf and thine own happineſs, the love of God and Chriſt, or love to God and Chriſt may have any influence upon thee, if any thing either of Divinity or Humanity may work upon thee, here is fulneſs of reaſon and motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee to open to Chriſt; and therefore let reaſon prevail with thee.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, How ſhall I open to Chriſt? And what would you have me in this caſe to do? I am willing to open to Chriſt,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45968:95"/>
if I knew but how to do it, and what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this caſe?</p>
               <p>That I may help thee a little in this great and neceſſary work, I ſhall give thee ſome directions, how to carry, and what to do, and ſo ſhall conclude this ſubject. And theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections ſhall be of two ſorts. 1. Such as may have reſpect unto the Heart, and the manner or way of the Hearts opening to Chriſt. 2. Such as may have reſpect to Chriſt, and the ſeveral ways of his coming in, and making himſelf manifeſt unto the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I begin with ſuch directions as reſpect the Heart, and the way and manner of the Hearts opening to Chriſt. Now that we may the better know how many ways the Heart muſt be opened to Chriſt, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to conſider how many ways the Heart may be ſhut againſt Chriſt. Now, it is evident that the Heart may theſe ſeveral ways be ſhut againſt Chriſt. By Pride and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: by unbelief: by impenitency: by want of Love, or coldneſs of affection: by ſloth and ſluggiſhneſs either in our watch or work. A little to open each of theſe, and then you ſhall ſee by them, what of the Heart, or in what reſpects the Heart is to be opened to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Heart may be ſhut againſt Chriſt by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45968:95"/>
Pride, and ſelf-confidence. Such is the Pride and haughtineſs of corrupted Nature, that though the ſinner be juſtly condemned for his ſin, yet he ſeeks to juſtifie himſelf, and would not ſeem to be beholden to Jeſus Chriſt nor his ſatisfaction for a pardon. This is evident in our firſt Parents, in their ſhifting off their ſins, and endeavouring to tranſmit the guilt upon ſome one elſe. <hi>Adam</hi> when examined, rather than he would be found faulty, lays the blame upon <hi>Eve,</hi> and in ſome ſenſe upon God himſelf: <hi>The woman which thou gaveſt me, gave me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I did eat.</hi> The woman, when examined, lays the guilt upon the Serpent: <hi>The Serpent beguiled me,</hi> &amp;c, And the ſame principle of Pride remains in ſome meaſure in the Hearts of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity; which makes them uſe their utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavour to juſtifie themſelves. This is the true cauſe of all excuſes that are made for ſin, and the reaſon why perſons do ſo over-much value their own works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, judging (in effect) that every ſmall parcel of duty and obedience is ſufficient to expiate the greateſt ſin. And by this means Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is undervalued, and little ſtore ſet by: For a man will never be wholly beholden to Jeſus Chriſt for his juſtification, while he hath any Righteouſneſs of his own to lean to.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45968:96"/>
And by this means the Heart is ſhut againſt Chriſt. As this Pride hardens God's heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſinner, and makes God to <hi>reſiſt,</hi> or ſet himſelf in battle-array againſt the ſinner, (as the word ſignifies) <hi>James</hi> 4.6. and as this ſelf-juſtifying confidence cauſeth Chriſt (many times) to paſs by the door of ſuch a ſinner without calling upon him; for he tells us, that <hi>he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance,</hi> Matth. 9.13. that is, thoſe that are (through Pride and ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) righteous in their own eyes: So this Pride doth harden and ſhut the heart of the ſinner againſt God and Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not ſeek after God.</hi> Pſal. 10.4. This therefore muſt be removed out of the way, before the door of the Heart be truly and fully opened to Chriſt. Wouldeſt thou therefore open to Chriſt, get rid of all Pride and ſelf-confidence: labour to be humble, low, and vile in thine own eyes; and to ſuch <hi>Chriſt will look,</hi> Iſai. 66.2. <hi>To this man will I look, that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and that trembles at my word.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>The poor have the Goſpel preached to them.</hi> i. e. They that are of a poor, humble, ſelf-denying ſpirit, have the glad tidings of Salvation brought unto them: to theſe <hi>the Son of Righteouſneſs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:45968:96"/>
ariſeth with healing under his wings.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>bleſſed are theſe poor in ſpirit, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> While <hi>David</hi> juſtified himſelf and hid his ſin, the hand of God was heavy upon him: but when he humbled himſelf and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed freely his ſin, God came in with pardon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. Oh therefore labour after humility and lowneſs of ſpirit; for <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Humble your ſelves</hi> therefore, <hi>and</hi> in due time <hi>God will exalt you</hi> with his preſence and company. Chriſt muſt do all, and have the glory, as well as the command of all, where he comes: and therefore he is fit company for none but thoſe that are humble, ſelf-denying, ſelf-condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Heart is many times ſhut againſt Chriſt by unbelief. Faith is the hand whereby Chriſt is received: Faith muſt open the door to Chriſt; and therefore where Faith is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the door of the Heart muſt needs be kept ſhut againſt Chriſt. Unbelief is one of the great Bars or Bolts, whereby the Heart is kept faſt ſhut againſt Chriſt. This Bar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be removed, before the Heart can be opened to Chriſt. The Apoſtle tells us the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Jews were rejected, was <hi>becauſe of their unbelief.</hi> Unbelief is the great Goſpel-ſin, the Rock upon which many a poor ſoul as
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45968:97"/>
plit. Therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> Beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of unbelief, and open to him by Faith. Chriſt gives many invitations and calls, ſuch as you read <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.1. &amp;c. Believe therefore that Chriſt is really willing to receive thoſe that he makes ſuch calls unto; and of thoſe number thou art, if thou doſt not wilfully exclude thy ſelf through unbelief. He makes many gracious promiſes of Pardon of Sin, of Adoption, Sanctification, and Life E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: and withal he tells thee upon what terms and conditions theſe things are to be had. Therefore by Faith embrace theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, apply them to thy ſelf, thankfully cloſe with them, and labour to anſwer the terms and conditions of them; and if thou doſt but on thy part manifeſt thy real willingneſs, thou ſhalt finde that he will come in unto thee with comfort and aſſurance. Therefore open to Chriſt by Faith: believe his word: embrace his promiſes: obey his commands: dread his threatnings: give up thy ſelf by covenant unto him, <hi>that he may be made of God unto thee wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes the heart is ſhut againſt Chriſt by impenitency. It is an opinion but too
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45968:97"/>
common and ordinary among Sinners, that Repentance is only needful in ſome few groſs caſes, for ſome great and notorious enormity; but as for ſins of a leſs magnitude, they look upon them as pardoned in courſe, without any conſiderable repentance. And therefore if they finde not themſelves guilty of ſuch great ſins, they conceit that they need no Repentance. In this ſenſe are thoſe words of our Saviour to be underſtood, Luke 15.7. <hi>Joy ſhall be in Heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons that need no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; i. e.</hi> that think they need no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and this is the ſecret thought but of too many in the world, and by this they ſhut out the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as a perſon that they have no great need of, or occaſion for; they think themſelves whole, and therefore ſee no need of a Phyſician. But he that would have Chriſt to come into his ſoul, muſt ſee a need of Chriſt, muſt ſee himſelf to be a ſinner, a great ſinner, loſt and undone without Chriſt, muſt ſee himſelf an enemy to God by nature, a rebel and traitor; and this his enmity he muſt repent of, be heartily ſorry for, muſt be really willing and deſirous of peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, muſt abhor himſelf for his former enmity, and reſolve (through the Grace of God) that he will ſtand no longer in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:45968:98"/>
oppoſition to God, but muſt come with an humble, broken, melted heart to God, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging pardon for what is by-paſt, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately reſolving and promiſing new and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience for time to come; and this he muſt do from a ſenſe of the ſinful and curſed nature of ſin. And upon this Repentance it is that Chriſt comes in, and is willing to be a Mediator between God and man. And therefore it thou wouldeſt open to Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſet thy ſelf ſeriouſly to the work of Repentance, perform that work throughly, let no known ſin, or ſin that thou canſt poſſibly diſcover in thy ſelf, paſs unrepented of. Go therefore into ſecret, examine thine own heart, what ſins thou canſt finde lodged there, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon them, with all the aggravating cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of them, and dwell ſo long upon the thoughts of them, till ſuch time as thou haſt brought thine heart to an utter loathing and abhorrence of them, and of thy ſelf for committing of them, and allowing thy ſelf in them; and till thou comeſt to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thy ſelf as worthy of eternal damnation, for hearkening to the temptation of them. And then let God hear thee bemoan thy ſelf, and complaining of thine own folly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and what a ſad and wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thou haſt brought thy ſelf into by thy ſins:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45968:98"/>
and beg help of God to turn thee, and bring thee unto Jeſus Chriſt, and beſtow him upon thee; and when this is done ſincerely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, thou ſhalt finde Chriſt ready to come in unto thy ſoul. See this exemplified in <hi>Ephraims</hi> repentance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. <hi>Surely I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf thus: Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a bubock unaccuſtomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God. After I was turned, I repented; after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh, I was aſhamed, yea even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth. Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a pleaſant Child? For ever ſince I ſpake againſt him, I earneſtly remember him ſtill: therefore I will ſurely have mercy upon him ſaith the Lord. Ephraim</hi> by repentance opened his heart to God, and then Gods heart was open towards him, and Gods bowels yearn towards him. Thus do thou <hi>humble thy ſelf</hi> to God, and <hi>in due time he will exalt thee.</hi> Open thine heart by Repentance, and thou wilt be fit for the reception of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes the heart may be ſhut againſt Chriſt by decay or want of Love. It is want of due love and reſpect to Chriſt, that is the cauſe why he is ſhut out of the Soul: did we love Chriſt more, we ſhould more readily open
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45968:99"/>
unto Chriſt; and did we more really and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently love him, we ſhould have more of his company. If Love be wanting, Chriſt cares not to come in that Soul; neither indeed will there be convenient room for Chriſt in that Soul. If thy love to Chriſt be cold, thy heart will be ſhut againſt him: for the Heart is naturally contracted and ſhut where love is wanting: and it is the very nature of Love to open, expand, or enlarge the Heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the object beloved. If therefore thou wouldeſt have Chriſt to come into thy Soul, ſet Love to work. Love will make Chriſt precious and deſirable to thy Soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſet thee a longing for Chriſt when he is abſent. Love will enlarge thy deſire, and make thee impatient of his abſence, and ſpur thee on to a more diligent ſeeking of him. Love will bid Chriſt welcome at his coming, and therefore will endeavour not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move whatever may be offenſive and diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, but to have all things in a readineſs and preparedneſs for his entertainment. Nay, Love makes the Soul to think no time loſt in his company, nor any coſt too great for his entertainment. And therefore if Love have been cold or wanting towards Chriſt, let it be ſo no more; but labour to get and maintain more fervent love to Chriſt, and this will be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45968:99"/>
the ready way to have his company: For Love will make thee to hunger after Chriſt; and he hath promiſed <hi>to ſatisfie the hungry ſoul.</hi> We read <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. that God threatens <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that he will depart, and <hi>remove his Golden Candleſtick from the midſt of her,</hi> becauſe of her decay in her <hi>Love</hi> towards him: ſhe had loſt <hi>her firſt love.</hi> And well he might; for the leſs ſhe loved him, the more was her Heart contracted and ſhut againſt him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore little room could he have in her Heart, and conſequently little heart to ſtay there. Take heed therefore of ſuffering thy love to Chriſt to decay, if thou haſt any minde of his company: but get thine heart filled with love to Chriſt, and then the door of thine Heart will be open to him, and he may have ready and welcome entertainment when he comes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The door of the Heart may be ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt by negligence and ſloth. Now there is a two-fold negligence which Chriſtians are ſubject unto. 1. A negligence or ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs in their work. Or 2. in their Watch: by the means of both which Jeſus Chriſt may be ſhut out of the Heart.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt may be ſhut out by our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and ſluggiſhneſs in our work. Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful working and labouring in our ſpiritual calling, doth but keep Chriſt out of the Soul.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45968:100"/>
When a man prays after a ſluggiſh and ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, he doth in effect ſay, that he mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not Chriſt's company; and therefore he cannot expect to finde him. For Chriſt <hi>will be found of thoſe that diligently ſeek him.</hi> A ſlothful man will ſcarcely be willing to wait in the way of duty till Chriſt come; but, like the Spouſe in the Text, will have laid aſide his work, and be gone to bed when Chriſt calls, and too lazy too to ariſe to open to him. Some perſons indeed are impatient of Chriſt's delays, becauſe of their earneſt deſire of his company, they are <hi>ſick of love:</hi> to theſe Chriſt <hi>will come, and will not tarry.</hi> Others are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient under delays, becauſe they are weary of duty, love not to tug, and toil, and ſweat in duty too long, but would have Chriſt come that their work might be over; and if he come not in their time, they leave off their work: theſe do ſhut out Chriſt. Wouldeſt thou therefore have thy heart open to Chriſt, be not ſlothful or ſluggiſh in duty, but be diligent, painful, and induſtrious in thy ſpiritual work. Be diligent in mortifying ſin, in quickning grace, in diſcharging duties, and thoſe of all ſorts: that ſo <hi>when Chriſt comes, he may finde thee ſo doing,</hi> buſily employed in thy Lords work; and then will he ſay to thee, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:45968:100"/>2. Jeſus Chriſt may be ſhut out by our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and ſluggiſhneſs in our watch. The Spouſe here had laid aſide her watch, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her ſelf for reſt, and now Chriſt at his coming found her door ſhut. When Sinners grow lazy, and let fall their watch, they are in a fitter poſture for Satan to finde them than Chriſt: For <hi>Satan goes about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour:</hi> and therefore his fitteſt opportunity is when he can finde them napping and ſecure. But Chriſt comes as a friend, and therefore would finde us watching: he comes as a Maſter, and therefore expects us to be ready to open to him.</p>
               <p>If therefore thou wouldeſt have thine heart open to Chriſt, keep a conſtant watch over thy ſelf: <hi>watch and pray, that thou enter not into temptation:</hi> Watch againſt the treachery, deceitfulneſs, and deſperate wickedneſs of thine own heart. Watch againſt the inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an enticing alluring world. Watch againſt the motions and ſuggeſtions of a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſubtile Devil. Watch thy corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they prevail not in thee. Watch thy graces, that they neither decay nor be idle. Watch thy Faith, that that may be ready to apprehend and embrace Chriſt at his coming. And watch thy Patience, that that wear not out, but endure to the end. And watch thy
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45968:101"/>
Love, that by the decays and coolings of that, thy Heart be not contracted and ſhut againſt Chriſt. Keep up an univerſal, conſtant, and faithful watch, if thou wouldeſt have the door of thine Heart open when Chriſt comes. Bleſſed is he whom his Lord when he comes ſhall find upon his Watch-tower, ready to open to him.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhewed in what reſpects the Heart may be ſhut againſt Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by directing you to the removal of them, and the exerciſe of the contrary grace, have inſtructed you how to get and keep the Heart open for Chriſt. To all which, I onely adde this one thing more.</p>
               <p>Wouldeſt thou have thine Heart open and in a readineſs to entertain Jeſus Chriſt at his coming? then live always in expectation of his coming, look for his coming: when the Servant thinks with himſelf, <hi>My Lord delays his coming,</hi> he will not come yet; he grows idle and careleſs, and neglects both his work and his watch: But if we would but thus judge, Our Lord and Maſter will come, and I know not at what hour of the day, or watch of the night; this would be a means to make us always to keep our Hearts open, and in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to receive Jeſus Chriſt at his coming: whereas the want of this makes us ſuffer our Faith to decay, our Love to cool, and our Hearts to be ſhut and contracted againſt Chriſt at his coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:45968:101"/>And theſe are the the Directions which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſpeak to, with reſpect unto our hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have ſome directions to give thee with reference to Chriſt, and the ſeveral ways of his coming into the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wouldeſt thou have thy heart open to Chriſt aright, then open thine heart to the knowledge of Chriſt. The directions which here I give, is the advice and councel of Chriſt himſelf, called by the name of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 1.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Wiſdom cryeth without, ſhe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth her voice in the ſtreets — How long ye ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones, will ye love ſimplicity? — and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you, and will make known my words unto you.</hi> The want of the right knowledge of Chriſt, is the great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or ground why the heart is kept ſo cloſe ſhut againſt Chriſt. You know, that one way of opening to Chriſt (which I told you of) was by faith, rolling and recumbing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt; and the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>They that know his Name, will put their truſt in him,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. and the reaſon rendered is, becauſe by knowing him they come to underſtand his truth and faithfulneſs, that he never <hi>forſakes</hi> them that <hi>diligently ſeek him.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the excellency, all-ſufficiency, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45968:102"/>
ſuitableneſs of Chriſt to our inſufficiency and emptineſs, that makes our love to Chriſt ſo very cold. For the proper object of Love is ſome ſuitable, deſireable good thing. Were we better acquainted then with that fulneſs that is in Chriſt, we ſhould more fully and freely open our hearts to Chriſt. Did we but ſee his lovelineſs in every reſpect, the loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his perſon, the lovelineſs of his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and qualifications, the lovelineſs of his works and undertakings, and his ſuitableneſs every way to our condition, we ſhould from the inward ſenſe of love in our own ſouls, cry out with the Spouſe, <hi>He is altogether lovely.</hi> Nay, our love towards him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after him, would be ſo fervent, that we ſhould ſay with the Spouſe, <hi>Tell him that I am ſick of love.</hi> If therefore thou wouldeſt have thine heart more open to Chriſt, ſtudy Chriſt better; for he hath ſaid, he will exalt, or <hi>ſet on high</hi> ſuch as <hi>know his Name,</hi> and ſet their love upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.14. And how can he more highly advance thee, than by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring thee with his company? Our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt makes us that we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his voice when he calls, and therefore we give no heed to his calls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Open thine heart to the commands of Chriſt; ſearch the Scriptures, to know what
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45968:102"/>
it is that he requires of thee: and as he teaches thee by his Word and Spirit, let thine heart be open to attend thereunto, as the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> was, who <hi>attended to the things that were ſpoken by Paul.</hi> Yea, let thine heart <hi>burn within thee,</hi> while he is talking with thee, as the hearts of the Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus</hi> did, while Chriſt talked with them. Attend diligently to the Ordinances of Chriſt, and come with the <hi>everlaſting doors</hi> of thine heart open, ready prepared to receive whatſoever divine truth God ſhall make known unto thee, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to practiſe what truths thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; let thine heart be ready to ſay, when thou comeſt to every Ordinance, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, <hi>Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth;</hi> or as <hi>Paul, Lord, what wouldeſt thou have me to do?</hi> Or as the people to <hi>Moſes,</hi> (but with a better heart, and more ſtedfaſt reſolution) <hi>All that the Lord hath ſpoken will we do, and be obedient.</hi> Open thine heart to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, and let <hi>none of his commands be grievous;</hi> but ſay with <hi>David, O how love I thy Law! it is my meditation day and night.</hi> Remember that Chriſt is thy Lord and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; it is his work to command thee, and it is thy duty in all things to obey, and therefore <hi>take his yoke upon thee — for his yoke is eaſie, and his burden light;</hi> and, <hi>in keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands there is great reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:45968:103"/>3. Open thine heart to the counſels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt: thou maiſt aſſure thy ſelf, that Chriſt will adviſe thee to nothing but for thy good. See what counſel Chriſt gives to the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>chap.</hi> his counſel was very ſuitable to the ſeveral ſtates and conditions of every Church. To inſtance in that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ſhe was a very luke-warm Church, and yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proud, ſelf-confident Church; ſhe ſaid, <hi>She was rich, and increaſed with goods, and had need of nothing; but knew not that ſhe was wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> And what was Chriſts counſel to her? <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me Gold tryed in the fire, that thou maiſt be rich, and white raiment that thou maiſt be cloathed, and that the ſhame of thy nakedneſs do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve, that thou maiſt ſee,</hi> Rev. 3.17, 18. Jeſus Chriſt is a moſt faithful Friend and Phyſician, will certainly give very ſeaſonable counſel and advice: he is called the <hi>wonderful Counſellor,</hi> Iſai. 9.6. Open thine heart, and liſten to the counſel which Chriſt gives to thee; he will inſtruct thee how to mortifie thy ſins; he will teach thee how to improve Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to perform Duties, to exerciſe thy graces; he will teach thee in all reſpects <hi>to order thy converſation aright,</hi> and to improve all the Diſpenſations of his Providence towards thee.

Take but Chriſts counſel and advice, and thou canſt never do amiſs: for he is wiſe in heart, and communicative of his wiſdome, never fails any that truſt and ſeek to him for counſel and advice: Read <hi>James</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any of you want wiſdom, let him ask it of God, who gives to all men liberally, and upbraideth no man, and it ſhall be given to him.</hi> But know this, that Chriſt cannot endure to have his counſel ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to do this would highly diſpleaſe him.

               <p n="4">4. Open thine Heart to the rebukes and chaſtiſements of Chriſt. Be not too wiſe in thine own conceit, as to think that Chriſt can finde no fault with thee: But as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks concerning the Righteous, ſo do thou from thy very heart ſay, <hi>Let the Righteous,</hi> Chriſt, <hi>ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs; let him reprove me,

it ſhall be an excellent oyl, which ſhall not break my head.</hi> Though thou knoweſt before hand that he will finde fault with thee at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet be never the more afraid to let him in, nor be thou weary of his rebukes. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant diſcourſe (many times) when our Friends rip up our faults, and tell us of them; but it is really our fault ſo to account it: for it is the real part of a Friend to <hi>reprove us, and not to ſuffer ſin upon our ſouls.</hi> However it may be unpleaſant, yet it is both neceſſary and ſafe. It argues a more than ordinary love of Chriſt towards thee, if he deal thus faithfully with thee: for <hi>whom he loves he rebukes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens,</hi> Rev. 3.19. Let thy Heart therefore be open, ready, and willing to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his moſt ſevere rebukes: And take it as a kindneſs from him that he will rebuke thee; for it is a piece of bleſſedneſs. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom the Lord rebukes and chaſtens, and teacheth him out of his Law,</hi> Pſal. 94.12. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> having found the benefit of this, ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75. <hi>I know, O Lord that thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are right, and that thou in faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them that are exerciſed thereby.</hi> Heb. 12.11. open therefore thy Heart to the rebukes of Chriſt, and willingly receive them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Open to the comforts of Chriſt. We read that when Chriſt came to his Diſciples when they were met together, his firſt ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he gave them was, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> Luke 24.36. And truely where Chriſt comes into the Soul, he brings true inward ſpiritual peace along with him, and freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows it upon his Spouſe. But yet, ſuch is the proneneſs of our natures to unbelief, that we many times refuſe the comforts which Chriſt brings, and do not apply them to our ſelves. Sinners indeed do many times ſnatch preſumptuouſly at theſe comforts, which do not of right belong unto them; nor indeed are they offered by Chriſt to them. But the People of God ſometimes, through a fooliſh and ſinful modeſty refuſe, or at leaſt are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to take and apply thoſe comforts which Chriſt at his coming brings with him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Chriſt is forced to invite, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to accept of them, as his free gifts which he is really willing and deſirous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon them. This is really a fault in pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the Soul. If he convince of and reprove for ſin, and thereby cauſe ſorrow and ſadneſs in the Soul, this ſearching is but in order to the healing of their wound, that they may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards have more ſolid peace and comfort. If he frown, it is but to make his ſmiles the more pleaſant, and make us to prize them the more. If he call us to, and put us upon more difficult, and (to the fleſh) unpleaſant work, it is but that thereby he may honour us the more, and his comfortable preſence ſhall be with us in it. If he caſt us down for a time, he will be careful that we be not overwhelmed with too much ſorrow, and will in due time lift us up; refuſe not therefore his comforts which are the deſigne of all his carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee whatever Chriſt doth, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may ſeem to carry towards thee; the ultimate end of all is to do thee good, and comfort thee; and therefore hath promiſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>That all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. Open to the love of Chriſt. I did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you before to open and enlarge your Hearts in love towards Chriſt. But now I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you to open your hearts to receive his love. When Chriſt comes and manifeſts real tokens and demonſtrations of his diſtinguiſhing ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love, do not you deſpiſe or reject theſe.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45968:105"/>
It is an hard matter to convince and perſwade ſome Chriſtians that Chriſt loves them, or at leaſt that his love is real and diſtinguiſhing, ſuch as he bears to his own children or Spouſe. They will eaſily grant that they love him, but cannot ſo eaſily believe that he loves them. But I would ask ſuch a Soul this queſtion: How cameſt thou thus to love Chriſt? If thy love be real, it is onely a reflex beam of Chriſt his love to thee; he muſt neceſſarily love thee before thou canſt love him: For certainly there was a time when thou didſt hate, as all unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſons do; and who made thee then to differ either from others, or from what thou thy ſelf once was? It can be nothing elſe but his love ſhed abroad in thy Heart. This is the argument pleaded, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.1. to the 15 <hi>v.</hi> Love is an affection not to be forced, but to be drawn, as is intimated, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7. <hi>If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would utterly be contemned.</hi> And it muſt be drawn by the diſcovery of ſome ſuitable and deſirable excellency in the object beloved, that may anſwer the need or deſire of the Soul that loveth. The Soul finding it ſelf empty or void of ſomething that might tend to the compleating of its happineſs (for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſts in the fulneſs of the Soul when it wants nothing; while it wants any thing it is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:45968:106"/>
not compleatly happy) upon this diſcovery of emptineſs in it ſelf, ſeeks out where ſuch a thing may be had; and finding Jeſus Chriſt to be that all ſufficient object which may every way anſwer the need and emptineſs of the Soul, loves him, with a love of deſire and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt longing after him, as the onely perſon, the enjoyment of whom can make her abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and perfectly happy. And ſo far as ſhe can enjoy him, ſo far ſhe is delighted and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with him. This is the true notion of love, and if thy love to Chriſt be right, it is ſuch a love as this.</p>
               <p>If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>refore upon the diſcovery of Chriſts excellency and perfection, anſwerable to thine indigence and emptineſs, thy ſoul doth truely love Chriſt. I would gladly know, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to thee this perfection and ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſt? (who is ſo generally d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſpiſed in the world). And who drew out thy heart in love to Chriſt, upon this account? Surely it muſt, it can be none but Chriſt, and if he thus with <hi>loving kindneſs have drawn thee,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is becauſe <hi>He hath loved thee with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love,</hi> Jer. 31.3. Thou haſt leſs reaſon therefore to queſtion the real love of Chriſt to thee, than to queſtion the reality of thy love to him: Open therefore thy heart freely to the love of Chriſt, and inſtead of queſtioning
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:45968:106"/>
the reality of Chriſts love to thee, rather ſtudy how thou maiſt by returns of love and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience anſwer ſo great love as he hath manifeſted towards thee. Study to improve and highly prize his love; for he firſt loved thee, or elſe thou couldeſt not have loved him at all.</p>
